= ISA Description Language (IDL)

The RISC-V ISA functionality is formally described in a domain specific language called ISA Description Language (IDL). The language is intended to be:

 * *Human readable* so that it can serve as a reliable documentation source.
 * *Familiar* to both hardware and software designers. For that reason, the syntax resembles a mix of Verilog and C++ (which both share inherit a C-like syntax).
 * *Strongly typed* to reduce ambiguity as a documentation source.
 * *Modular* to reflect RISC-V's modular ISA structure. IDL can describe a wide range of devices, and then be customized with configuration variables to generate an implementation-specific description.

IDL is used to describe the behavior of RISC-V instructions, fetch, and, in some cases where behavior is specialized, CSRs. Taken together, the IDL can be converted into a fully functioning Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) that is a golden model of execution.

== Examples

=== Instruction definition

Instruction execution semantics are defined in IDL. Below is an example showing how to specify the Branch if Less Than or Equal Unsigned (BLTU) instruction.

.IDL for BLTU instruction. `rs1`, `rs2`, and `imm` are fields extracted from the instruction encoding.
[example]
====
[source,idl]
----
Bits<XLEN> src1 = X(rs1); <1>
Bits<XLEN> src2 = X(rs2); <2>

if (src1 <= src2) { <3>
  jump(PC + $signed(imm)); <4>
}
# fall through: advance to next instruction
----
<1> Read general-purpose X register number `rs1`, and store it in XLEN-bit variable `src1`. XLEN is a configuration parameter that is available as a global constant in IDL.
<2> Read general-purpose X register number `rs2`, and store it in variable `src2`.
<3> Check if unsigned `src1` is less than or equal to unsigned `src2`.
<4> Call the `jump` function with a target address formed by adding a signed immediate to the PC.
====

.IDL for `jump` function.
[example]
====
[source,idl]
----
function jump {
  arguments XReg target_addr <1>
  description { <2>
    Jump to virtual address `target_addr`.

    If target address is misaligned, raise a `MisalignedAddress` exception.
  }
  body { <3>
    # raise a misaligned exception if address is not aligned to IALIGN
    if (implemented?(ExtensionName::C) &&         # C is implemented
        (CSR[misa].C == 0x1) &&                   # and C is enabled dynamically
        ((target_addr & 0x1) != 0)) {             # and the target PC is odd
      raise(ExceptionCode::InstructionAddressMisaligned); <4>
    } else if ((target_addr & 0x3) != 0) {
      raise(ExceptionCode::InstructionAddressMisaligned);
    }

    PC = target_addr; <5>
  }
}
----
<1> Declare that function 'jump' takes a single argument of type `XReg` (alias of `Bits<XLEN>`).
<2> A mandatory description of the function.
<3> IDL statements for the instruction execution are placed in body {...}
<4> Trigger a synchronous exception by calling the `raise` function.
<5> Set the new PC to the target address.

== Basics

Comments in IDL are identified by a hash (#) symbol. Everything after the hash until the end of the line is a comment. There is no multi-line comment (like `/* */` in C++).

# this is a comment
Boolean condition; # this is also a comment

IDL is case sensitive.

== Data Types

=== Primitive Types

IDL has two primitive types: `Bits<N>` and `Boolean`.

The `Bits<N>` type is an array of N bits that is treated like an integer for arithmetic and logical operators. `Bits<N>` are unsigned by default, but can be cast to a signed version when it would make a difference (_e.g._, for signed comparison). See Section <<Casting>>. `N` must be a value known at compile time: either a literal, a constant (_e.g._, a configuration parameter), or an expression where every component is known at compile time.

.Examples of Bits<N> declarations
[source,idl]
----
Bits<1>       sign_bit;              # 1-bit unsigned variable
Bits<XLEN>    virtual_address;       # XLEN-bit unsigned variable
Bits<XLEN*2>  multiplication_result; # unsigned variable twice as wide as XLEN

# Bits<sign_bit> invalid;              # compile error: N must be known at compile time
----

The `Boolean` type is either true or false, and cannot be mixed with `Bits<N>`.

There are several aliases available, as shown below.

.Primitive type aliases

|===
| Alias | Type

| `XReg`  | `Bits<XLEN>`
| `U64`   | `Bits<64>`
| `U32`   | `Bits<32>`
|===

=== User-defined Types

IDL also supports two user-defined types: enumerations and bitfields.

An enumeration is a set of named integer values. Unlike C/C++ enums, enumeration members are not promoted to the surrounding scope. To reference a member, it must be fully qualified using the scope operator `::`.

Enumerations are declared using the `enum` keyword. Both enumeration names and members must begin with a capital letter. Enumeration members may optionally be assigned a value; if no value is given, it will receive the value of the previous member plus one. Duplicate values are allowed.

Enumeration members can be treated like integers. When that occurs, their type is Bits<N>, where N is the bit width required to represent any member of the enumeration.

[source,idl]
----
enum SatpMode {
  Bare 0
  Sv32 1
  Sv39 8
  Sv48 9
  Sv57 10
}

enum MemoryOperation {
  Read            # will get value 0
  Write           # will get value 1
  ReadModifyWrite # will get value 2
  Fetch           # will get value 3
}

# references
SatpMode cur_mode = SatpMode::Sv39;
Bits<2> op = MemoryOperation::Fetch; # ok, op gets 2'd3
----

Bitfields represent named ranges within a contiguous array of bits. They are useful, for example, to describe the fields in a page table entry. Bitfield names and members must begin with a capital letter. Bitfields are explictly declared with a bit width. Bitfield members specify the range they occupy in the bitfield. Members may overlap, which enables aliasing. Gaps may exist in a bitfield (where no member exists); such gaps are read-only zero bits.

[source,idl]
----
# declare a 64-bit bitfield
bitfield (64) Sv39PageTableEntry {
  N 63
  PBMT 62-61
  # Reserved 60-54  # will be read-only zero
  PPN2 53-28
  PPN1 27-19
  PPN0 18-10
  PPN 53-10 # in addition to the components, we define the entire PPN
  RSW  9-8
  D 7
  A 6
  G 5
  U 4
  X 3
  W 2
  R 1
  V 0
}

# references
Bits<64> pte_data = get_pte(...);

# bitfields can be assigned with Bits<N>,
# where N must be the width of the bitfield
Sv39PageTableEntry pte = pte_data;

# members are accessed with the '.' operator
Bits<2> pbmt = pte.PBMT;
----

Technically, IDL also has a tuple type that is used to return multiple values from a function. However, they cannot be instantiated outside of a function call, and must be immediately decomposed into individual variables (_i.e._, you cannot create a tuple variable). Thus, tuples will not be discussed further.

== Integer literals

Integer literal values can be expressed using either C style or Verilog style. When using Verilog style, the literal bit width can be specified. If the width is omitted using the verilog style, the bit width will be XLEN. When using C style, the bitwidth is the minimum number of bits needed to represent the value.

A signed literal is allocated an extra bit to support negation. The literal itself is always positive, but may be immediately negated to get a negative value. For that reason, be careful
constructing negative literals (see example below).

Literals may contain any number of underscores after the initial digit for clarity. The underscores are ignored when determining the value.

== Operators

Integer types (`Bits<N>`, `U64`) support most of the same operators as Verilog, and use the same order of
precedence. Notably excluded are many of the bitwise reduction operators (e.g., and-reduce, or-reduce, etc.).

Binary operators between operands of different bit widths will extend the smaller operand to the size of the larger operand prior to the operation. When the smaller operand is signed, the extension is a sign extension; otherwise, the extension is a zero extension.

The result of a binary operation is signed if both operands are signed; otherwise, the result is unsigned.

.IDL operators in precedence order, with 0 being highest. For an operand `i` (which may be an expression), `L(i)` is the number of bits in `i` and `typeof(i)` is the exact type of `i`

                                                             `c` must be boolean, and `t` and `f` must be identical types.

== Variables and constants

Variables must be declared with a type. Variable names must begin with a lowercase letter and can be followed by any number of letters (any case), numbers, or an underscore. 

Variables may be optionally initialized when they are declared using the assignment operator. Variables that are not explicitly initialized are implicitly initialized to zero (for Bits<N>) or false (for Boolean).

.Example variable declarations
[source,idl]
----
Boolean condition;              # declare condition, initialized to false
XReg    address = 0x8000_0000;  # declare address, initialized to 0x800000000
Bits<8> pmpCfg0;                # declare pmpCfg0, initialized to 8'd0
Bits<8> pmp_cfg_0;              # declare pmp_cfg_0, initialized to 8'd0

# Bits<8> PmpCfg;   # mutable variable names must start with a lowercase letter. PmpCfg would be a constant
# Bits<8> d$_line;  # compilation error: '$' is not a valid variable name character
----

The general-purpose RISC-V x registers are builtin state for IDL (rather than being declared state). This is to accommodate special-cases regarding the x registers without without needing special language support (e.g., operator overloading) or ugly function calls on every X register access (_e.g._, set_xreg(index, value)):

 . The x0 register is hardwired to 0
 . All writes to an x register when MXLEN != the current XLEN are sign-extended to MXLEN.
 . All reads from an x register when MXLEN != the current XLEN ignore the upper bits of the register.

[NOTE]
To help identify that the x registers are special, they use the variable name `X` (upper case X), which would be an invalid variable name if declared in IDL.

Constant names must start with an uppercase letter and can be followed by any number of letters (any case), numbers, or an underscore. Constants must be initialized when declared, and cannot be assigned after declaration. Constants must be initialized with a value known at compile time (_i.e._, initialization cannot reference variables).

Note that many global constants, such are configuration parameters, are implicitly added before parsing (_e.g._, XLEN).

.Example constant declarations
[source,idl]
----
Boolean I_LIKE_CHEESE = true;   # declare I_LIKE_CHEESE, initialized to true
XReg    Address = 0x8000_0000;  # declare Address, initialized to 0x800000000

# Bits<8> pmpCfg;  # constant names must start with a lowercase letter. pmpCfg would be a variable

# compilation error: '$' is not a valid constant name character
# Bits<8> d$_line;

# compilation error: constant initialization cannot reference variables
# Bits<8> PmpCfg = my_cfg;

# compilation error: constants must be initialized at declaration
# Bits<8> PmpCfg0;

== Type conversions

Type conversions occur when dissimilar types are used in some binary operators or assignments. 

`Bits<N>` types are converted as follows:

.Bits<N> width conversion
|===
| Expression                  | `N < M` | `N > M`

| `Bits<N> binary_op Bits<M>` | `Bits<N>` is expanded to `Bits<M>` | `Bits<M>` is expanded to `Bits<N>`
| `Bits<N> = Bits<M>` | Upper `M-N` bits of `Bits<M>` are discarded | `Bits<M>` is expanded to `Bits<N>`
|===

When expansion occurs, the value is zero extended when the type is unsigned and sign extended when the type is signed.

Enumeration members can converted to a `Bits<N>` type, where N is the bit width required to represent all values in the enumeration.

Bitfields can be converted to a `Bits<N>` type, where N is the width of the bitfield. The type of any bitfield member access is `Bits<N>`, where N is the width of the member.

== Casting

There are two explicit cast operators in IDL: `$isgned` and `$bits`.

Unsigned Bits<N> values may be cast to signed values using the `$signed` cast operator.

[source,idl]
----
XReg src1 = -1;
XReg src2 = 0;

XReg cmp1 = (src1 < src2) ? 1 : 0;                    # cmp = 0
XReg cmp1 = ($signed(src1) < $signed(src2)) ? 1 : 0;  # cmp = 1
----

The '$bits' cast can convert Enumeration references and CSRs into a Bits<N> type.
When the casted value is an enumeration reference, the resulting type will be large enough to hold the largest value in the enumeration type, regardless of the specific reference value.
When the casted value is a CSR, the resulting type will the width of the CSR, or the maximum width when a CSR width is dynamic.

[source,idl]
----
# assuming:
# enum RoundingMode {
#   RNE 0  # Round to nearest, ties to even
#   RTZ 1  # Round toward zero
#   RDN 2  # Round down (towards -inf)
#   RUP 3  # Round up (towards +inf)
#   RMM 4  # Round to nearest, ties to Max Magnitude
# }
$bits(RoundingMode::RNE)  # => 3'd0
$bits(RoundingMode::RUP)  # => 3'd3

$bits(CSR[mstatus])  # => XLEN'd?? 
----

== Control flow

IDL provides if/else and for loops for control flow.

An if statement condition must be a Boolean type; integers are not implictly converted to Booleans (_e.g._, testing whether an integer is 0).

[source,idl]
----
XReg src1 = X[rs1];

if (src == 0) {
  # then statements
} else if (src == 1) {
  # else if statements
} else {
  # else statements
}

# compilation error: conditions must be boolean
# if (src) {
#   ...
# }
----

for loops specify an initialization, a ending condition, and a loop operation (similar to both C/C++ and Verilog). The condition expression must be a Boolean type.

[source,idl]
----
# iterate 128 times
for (U32 i = 0; i < 32; i = i + 1) {
  # i may be used in the loop body
  X[i] = 0;
}

# equivalent to above; the post-increment operator is available in the for loop operation expression
for (U32 i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
  # i may be used in the loop body
  X[i] = 0;
}
----

== Functions

The basic form of a function declaration is below.

[source,idl]
----
function NAME { <1>
  template TYPE_1 t1[, TYPE_2 t2[, ...]] <2>
  returns [TYPE_1, [TYPE_2[, ...]]] <3>
  arguments [TYPE_A a[, TYPE_B B[, ...]]] <4>
  description {
    A text description. <5>
  }
  body {
    <6>
  }
}
----
<1> Declare a function named NAME.
<2> Optionally declare any template arguments, discussed in <<Templated functions>>
<3> Optionally declare return type(s). May be omitted for void functions. May be a list if function returns multiple values.
<4> Optionally declare function argument(s). May be omitted if function has no arguments. May be a list if function accepts multiple arguments.
<5> A description of the function. May contain any character except '}', including newlines.
<6> The executable statements of the function.

Functions must be given a textual description; this is to promote IDL as an executable documentation source.

All arguments and return values are passed by value. There are no references in IDL.

Functions must live in global scope. Functions cannot be nested, and cannot be defined in an instruction or csr scope (see <<Scopes>>). 

A function may return zero or more values of any valid type. A function may accept zero or more arguments of any valid type.

Functions have no address. They can only be called, and function objects cannot be assigned to a variable.

Recursive functions are not allowed.

=== Templated functions

IDL supports templated functions that take a compile-time-known constant as an argument. A templated function in IDL is analogous to a templated function in C++ or a parameterized module/function in Verilog.

IDL only supports template values (_i.e._, you cannot pass a type as a template argument). Template values must be a Bits<N> type.

Template functions are called using C++-style syntax, with the template argument enclosed in angle brackets. 

IDL cannot infer template arguments; they must be provided explictly.

.Example of template function
[example]
====
.Declaring a templated function
[source,idl]
----
function popcount {
  template U64 INPUT_LEN, U64 OUTPUT_LEN
  returns Bits<OUTPUT_LEN>
  arguments Bits<INPUT_LEN> value
  description { Returns the number of 1s in `value`. }
  body {
    # ...
  }
}
----
.Calling template arguments
[source,idl]
----
Bits<5> cnt = popcount<32, 5>(32'haaaaaaaa); # cnt = 16
# Bits<5> cnt = popcount(32'haaaaaaaa); # compilation error: no template arugments given
----
====

=== Builtin functions

Functions may be declared as builtin. Builtin functions do not have a body defined in IDL. It is up to the backend to provide the implementation.

Builtin functions are generally used for two reasons:

 . To define functionality that is not architecturally visible (e.g., prefetch an address).
 . To define functionality that is highly implementation-dependent (e.g., fence).

Builtin functions look just like a normal function but with the keyword `builtin` before the function definition and no body.

.Builtin function definition
[example]
====
[source,idl]
----
builtin function sfence_asid {
  arguments Bits<ASID_WIDTH> asid
  description {
    Ensure all reads and writes using address space 'asid' see any previous
    address space invalidations.

    Does not have to (but may, if conservative) order any global mappings.
  }
  # note, there is no body
}
----
====

== Scope

Variables and/or constants are defined in the scope of the declaration. IDL has 6 scopes: global, function, instruction, csr, if, and for. Name shadowing, where a variable name is the same as an existing variable in an outer scope, is prohibited and will result in a compilation error.

Global scope is the upper-most scope of any .idl file. IDL representing an instruction execution (Section QQQ) or CSR read/write (Section QQQ) starts in function scope; it is not possible to declare a global in those contexts. Note that many global constants are declared implictly by the compiler (_e.g._, all configuration parameters).

[source,idl]
----
Bits<64> x[32]; # global constant (when this is an .idl file)

function example {
  return_type Bits<XLEN>
  arguments Bits<XLEN> a, Bits<XLEN> b # a and b are in function scope
  description {
    If a > b, return a+b. If a <= b, return a - b.
  }
  body {
    Bits<XLEN> result;  # result is in function scope

    if (a > b) {
      # Bits<XLEN> result = a + b; # compilation error: result shadows variable above
      Bits<XLEN> sum = a + b;  # ok
      result = sum;
    } else {
      Bits<XLEN> difference = a - b; # ok
      result = difference;
    }

    # result = sum; compilation error: sum is not in scope
    return result;
  }
}
