  revision_history:
  - revision: "0.7"
    date: 2024-07-29
    changes:
    - First version after moving non-microcontroller content in this document to a new document
      called “RISC-V CRDs (Certification Requirement Documents)”
    - Change MC100 Unpriv ISA spec from
      “https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/riscv-spec-v2.1.pdf[riscv-spec-v2.1], May 31,
      2016” to https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/tag/Ratified-IMAFDQC since the
      former isn't ratified by the latter is the oldest ratified version.
    - Added requirements for WFI instruction
    - Added requirements related to msip memory-mapped register
  - revision: "0.6"
    date: 2024-07-11
    changes:
    - Supporting multiple MC versions to support customers wanting to certify existing microcontrollers not using the latest version of ratified standards.
    - Changed versioning scheme to use major.minor.patch instead of 3-digit major & minor.
    - Added a table showing the mapping from MC version to ISA manuals.
    - Reluctantly made interrupts OUT OF SCOPE for MC100 since only the CLINT interrupt controller
      was ratified at that time and isn’t anticipated to be the interrupt controller used by MC100 implementations.
    - Clarified MANDATORY behaviors for mie and mip CSRs
    - Removed canonical discovery recipe because the OPT-* options directly inform the certification
      tests and certification reference model of the status of the various options. Also, canonical
      discovery recipes (e.g., probing for CLIC) violate the certification approach of avoiding writing
      potentially illegal values to CSR fields.
    - Added more options for interrupts
    - Moved non-microcontroller content in this document to a new document called “RISC-V Certification Plans”
  - revision: "0.5"
    date: 2024-06-03
    changes:
    - Renamed to “RISC-V Microcontroller Certification Plan” based on Jason’s recommendation
    - Added mvendorid, marchid, mimpid, and mhardid read-only priv CSRs because Allen pointed out
      these are mandatory in M-mode v1.13 (probably older versions too, haven’t looked yet).
    - Added table showing mapping of MC versions to associated RISC-V specifications
  - revision: "0.4"
    date: 2024-06-03
    changes:
    - Added M-mode instruction requirements
    - Made Zicntr MANDATORY due to very low cost for implementations to support (in the spirit of minimizing options).
    - Removed OPT-CNTR-PREC since minstret and mcycle must be a full 64 bits to be standard-compliant.
  - revision: "0.3"
    date: 2024-05-25
    changes:
    - Includes Zicntr as OPTIONAL and then has only 32-bit counters for instret and cycle.
  - revision: "0.2"
    date: 2024-05-20
    changes:
    - Very early draft
  - revision: "0.1"
    date: 2024-05-16
    changes:
    - Initial version

  description: |
    MC100 can be though of as minimal 32-bit RISC-V processors with M-mode support:

    * The Unprivileged ISA is RV32I with a few extensions suitable for a basic microcontroller
    * The M-mode features are those listed as mandatory in the associated RISC-V Privileged ISA manual

    Key features not included in MC100 (i.e., OUT OF SCOPE):

    * Interrupt Controller (e.g., CLIC, CLINT, PLIC)
    * Features for modes other than M-mode
    * PMP
    * Debug & trace (TBD)
