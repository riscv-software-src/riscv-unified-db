    Bits to inhibit (stops counting) performance counters.

    The counter-inhibit register `mcountinhibit` is a *WARL* register that
    controls which of the hardware performance-monitoring counters
    increment. The settings in this register only control whether the
    counters increment; their accessibility is not affected by the setting
    of this register.

    When the CY, IR, or HPM__n__ bit in the `mcountinhibit` register is clear,
    the `mcycle`, `minstret`, or `mhpmcountern` register increments as usual.
    When the CY, IR, or HPM_n_ bit is set, the corresponding counter does
    not increment.

    The `mcycle` CSR may be shared between harts on the same core, in which
    case the `mcountinhibit.CY` field is also shared between those harts,
    and so writes to `mcountinhibit.CY` will be visible to those harts.

    If the `mcountinhibit` register is not implemented, the implementation
    behaves as though the register were set to zero.

    [NOTE]
    ====
    When the `mcycle` and `minstret` counters are not needed, it is desirable
    to conditionally inhibit them to reduce energy consumption. Providing a
    single CSR to inhibit all counters also allows the counters to be
    atomically sampled.

    Because the `mtime` counter can be shared between multiple cores, it
    cannot be inhibited with the `mcountinhibit` mechanism.
