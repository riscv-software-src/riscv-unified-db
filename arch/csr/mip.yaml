        Reports the current pending state of an (H)S-mode external interrupt.

        This field has two parts: a software-writeable shadow value and a wire from the interrupt controller.
        The value presented to software in the bit on a CSR read is the logical OR of the software-writeable value and the interrupt controller value.
        When software writes this bit, only the shadow value is updated (the interrupt controller is not notified of the write).
