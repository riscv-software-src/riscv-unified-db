        *M-mode Interrupt Enable*
        
        Written by hardware in two cases:

        * Written with the value 0 when entering M-mode from an exception/interrupt.
        * Written with the prior value of `mstatus.MPIE` when returning from an exeception in M-mode (via `mret`).

        Affects execution by:

        * When 0, all interrupts are disabled when the current privilege level is M.
        * When 1, interrupts that are not otherwise disabled with a field in `mie` are enabled.

        *S-mode Interrupt Enable*
        
        Written by hardware in two cases:

        * Written with the value 0 when entering (H)S-mode from an exception/interrupt.
        * Written with the prior value of `mstatus.SPIE` when returning from an exeception via `sret` in (H)S-mode or (unlikely) M-mode.

        Affects execution by:

        * When 0, all (H)S-mode interrupts are disabled when the current privilege level is (H)S (M-mode interrupts are still enabled).
        * When 1, (H)S-mode interrupts that are not otherwise disabled with a field in `sie` are enabled.
