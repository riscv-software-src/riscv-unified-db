  The `mcyclecfg` CSR is a 64-bit machine-level register that configures privilege
  mode filtering for the cycle counter. Each inhibit bit (xINH) suppresses
  counting of events in the corresponding privilege mode when set.

  | Field   | Description                                         |
  |---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
  | MINH    | If set, then counting of events in M-mode is inhibited.     |
  | SINH    | If set, then counting of events in S/HS-mode is inhibited.  |
  | UINH    | If set, then counting of events in U-mode is inhibited.     |
  | VSINH   | If set, then counting of events in VS-mode is inhibited.    |
  | VUINH   | If set, then counting of events in VU-mode is inhibited.    |

  When all xINH bits are zero, event counting is enabled in all modes.

  For each bit in 61:58, if the associated privilege mode is not implemented,
  the bit is read-only zero.

   Bit 63 is read-only 0, since the cycle counter does not generate overflow interrupts.

  Bits [62:58] (xINH) are writable inhibit bits corresponding to each privilege mode:
  If a bit is set, counting is inhibited in that mode.
  
  If the corresponding mode is not implemented, the bit is read-only zero.

  Bits [57:0] are reserved (WPRI) and read as zero; writes to them are ignored.

  For RV32, the upper 32 bits of `mcyclecfg` are accessed via `mcyclecfgh` at CSR address 0x721.

  Note: Although CSR address 0x320 would have been a more natural choice,
  it is already allocated to `mcountinhibit`.
