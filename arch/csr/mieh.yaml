  The `mieh` CSR holds the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit `mie` register on RV32 systems.

  Like `mie`, this register enables individual interrupts, but for interrupt IDs 32â€“63.
  This register is only present if Supervisor mode is implemented, and only meaningful
  if external interrupt sources are defined in that upper range.

  WARL: Writes to unsupported or unimplemented bits are ignored and read as zero.
  Writable bits can be discovered by writing all 1s and reading back the value.

      Interrupt enable bits 32-63. Each bit enables the corresponding interrupt
      if supported. Unsupported bits are read-only zero.
