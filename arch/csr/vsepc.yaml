      When a trap is taken into VS-mode, `vsepc.PC` is written with the virtual address of the
      instruction that was interrupted or that encountered the exception.
      Otherwise, `vsepc.PC` is never written by the implementation, though it may be explicitly written
      by software.

      On an exception return from VS-mode (from the SRET instruction),
      control transfers to the virtual address read out of `vsepc.PC`.

      Because PCs are always <% if ext?(:C) %>halfword<% else %>word<% end %>-aligned,
      <% if ext?(:C) %>bit 0<% else %>bits 1:0<% end %> of `vsepc.PC` are always
      read-only 0.

      [when,"ext?(:C) && MUTABLE_MISA_C == true"]
      When `misa.C` is clear, bit 1 is masked to zero. Writes to bit 1 are still captured, and
      may be visible on the next read with `misa.C` is set.

      Holds bits 63:<%= ext?(:C) ? 2 : 1 %> of the virtual address associated with an exception.
