  For each hstateen CSR, bit 63 is defined to control access to the matching sstateen CSR.
  Bit 63 of hstateen0 controls access to sstateen0.

  With the hypervisor extension, the hstateen CSRs have identical encodings to the mstateen
  CSRs, except controlling accesses for a virtual machine (from VS and VU modes).

  For every bit in an hstateen CSR that is zero (whether read-only zero or set to zero),
  the same bit appears as read-only zero in sstateen when accessed in VS-mode.

  A bit in an hstateen CSR cannot be read-only one unless the same bit is read-only one
  in the matching mstateen CSR.

  CSRIND:
    location: 60
    base: 64
    description: |
      The CSRIND bit in hstateen0 controls access to the siselect and the
      sireg*, (really vsiselect and vsireg*) CSRs provided by the Sscsrind
      extensions.
    type: RW
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
  AIA:
    location: 59
    base: 64
    description: |
      The AIA bit in hstateen0 controls access to all state introduced by
      the Ssaia extension and is not controlled by either the CSRIND or the
      IMSIC bits of hstateen0.
    type: RW
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
  IMSIC:
    location: 58
    base: 64
    description: |
      The IMSIC bit in hstateen0 controls access to the guest IMSIC state,
      including CSRs stopei (really vstopei), provided by the Ssaia extension.

      Setting the IMSIC bit in hstateen0 to zero prevents a virtual machine
      from accessing the hart’s IMSIC the same as setting `hstatus.`VGEIN = 0.

    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
  CONTEXT:
    location: 57
    base: 64
    description: |
      The CONTEXT bit in hstateen0 controls access to the scontext CSR provided
      by the Sdtrig extension.
    type: RW
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
  JVT:
    location: 2
    description: |
      The JVT bit controls access to the jvt CSR provided by the Zcmt extension.
    type: RW
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
  FCSR:
    location: 1
    description: |
      The FCSR bit controls access to fcsr for the case when floating-point instructions
      operate on x registers instead of `f` registers as specified by the Zfinx and related
      extensions (Zdinx, etc.). Whenever misa.F = 1, FCSR bit of mstateen0 is read-only
      zero (and hence read-only zero in hstateen0 and sstateen0 too). For convenience,
      when the stateen CSRs are implemented and misa.F = 0, then if the FCSR bit of a
      controlling stateen0 CSR is zero, all floating-point instructions cause an illegal
      instruction trap (or virtual instruction trap, if relevant), as though they all access
      fcsr, regardless of whether they really do.
    type: RW
    reset_value: UNDEFINED_LEGAL
  C:
    location: 0
    description: |
      The C bit controls access to any and all custom state. This bit is not custom state itself.
      The C bit of these registers is not custom state itself; it is a standard field of a
      standard CSR, either mstateen0, hstateen0, or sstateen0.
