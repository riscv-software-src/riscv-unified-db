mconfigptr:
  long_name: Machine Configuration Pointer
  address: 0xF15
  description: |
    Holds a physical address pointer to the unified discovery data structure in Memory.

    The `mconfigptr` holds the physical
    address of a configuration data structure. Software can traverse this
    data structure to discover information about the harts, the platform,
    and their configuration.

    The pointer alignment in bits must be no smaller than MXLEN:
    i.e., if MXLEN is
    latexmath:[$8\times n$], then `mconfigptr`[latexmath:[$\log_2n$]-1:0]
    must be zero.

    The `mconfigptr` register must be implemented, but it may be zero to indicate the
    configuration data structure does not exist or that an alternative
    mechanism must be used to locate it.

    [NOTE]
    ====
    The format and schema of the configuration data structure have yet to be
    standardized.

    ***

    While the `mconfigptr` register will simply be hardwired in some implementations,
    other implementations may provide a means to configure the value
    returned on CSR reads. For example, `mconfigptr` might present the value
    of a memory-mapped register that is programmed by the platform or by
    M-mode software towards the beginning of the boot process.
