        Written with trap-specific information when a trap is taken into M-mode.

        The values are:

        [separator="!"]
        !===
        ! Exception type ! Value

        ! [0] Instruction address misaligned ! The misaligned virtual PC (same as the value written to `mepc`).
        ! [1] Instruction access fault ! The <% if ext?(:C) %> portion of the <% end %> virtual PC causing the access fault <%- unless ext?(:C) -%>(same as the value written to `mepc`)<%- end -%>.
        ! [2] Illegal Instruction ! The encoding of the illegal instruction.
        ! [3] Breakpoint
        ! [when,"REPORT_VA_IN_MTVAL_ON_BREAKPOINT == true"]
          When caused by an EBREAK instruction, the virtual PC of the breakpoint instruction.

          [when,"REPORT_VA_IN_MTVAL_ON_BREAKPOINT == false"]
          When caused by an EBREAK instruction, zero.

          When caused by a data address (_i.e._, watchpoint) breakpoint, the faulting virtual address.
          When caused by an instruction address breakpoint, the faulting virtual PC.
        ! [4] Load address misaligned ! The misaligned virtual load address.
        ! [5] Load access fault
        ! The part of virtual load address causing in the access fault.

          When the load is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
          (_e.g._, if an 8-byte load is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page,
          address + 4 is reported).

          (Even though the access fault arises on a physical address, the virtual address is reported)
        ! [6] Store/AMO address misaligned ! The misaligned virtual store/AMO address.
        ! [7] Store/AMO access fault
        ! The virtual store/AMO address causing the access fault.
        
          When the store/AMO is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
          (_e.g._, if an 8-byte store is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page,
          address + 4 is reported).

          (Even though the access fault arises on a physical address, the virtual address is reported)
        ! [8] Environment call from U-mode <% if ext?(:H) %>or VU-mode<% end %> ! Zero
        ! [9] Environment call from (H)S-mode ! Zero
        <%- if ext?(:H) -%>
        ! [10] Environment call from VS-mode ! Zero
        <%- end -%>
        ! [11] Environment call from M-mode ! Zero
        ! [12] Instruction page fault
        ! The <% if ext?(:C) %> portion of the <% end %> virtual PC causing the page fault
          <% unless ext?(:C) %>(same as the value written to `mepc`)<% end %>.
        ! [13] Load page fault
        ! The part of the virtual load address causing in the page fault.
          
          When the load is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
          (_e.g._, if an 8-byte load is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page, address + 4 is reported).
        ! [15] Store/AMO page fault
        ! The virtual store/AMO address causing in the page fault.
          
          When the store/AMO is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
          (_e.g._, if an 8-byte store is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page, address + 4 is reported).
        <%- if ext?(:H) -%>
        ! [20] Instruction guest-page fault
        ! The <% if ext?(:C) %> portion of the <% end %> virtual PC causing the fault <% unless ext?(:C) %>(same as the value written to `mepc`)<% end %>.
        
          The guest physical address is reported in `mtval2`.
        ! [21] Load guest-page fault
        ! The part of the virtual address causing the fault.

          When the load is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
          (_e.g._, if an 8-byte load is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page, address + 4 is reported).
          
          The guest physical address is reported in `mtval2`.
        ! [22] Virutal instruction
        ! The encoding of the faulting virtual instruction.
        ! [23] Store/AMO guest-page fault
        ! The part of the virtual address causing the fault.
