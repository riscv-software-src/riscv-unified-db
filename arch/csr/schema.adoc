= Schema for CSR definitions

A CSR definition is a mapping (_i.e._, hash, dictionary, ...) containing exactly one key
equal to the CSR name, and pointing to an object specified below. For example:

.CSR object
[source,yaml]
----
mstatus:
  long_name: Machine status
  # ...
----

The CSR object has the following information:

|===

Address::

[IMPORTANT] `address` is a required key *unless* the CSR is only accessible through the indirect registers of the `Smcsrind`/`Sscrind` extensions, in which case `indirect_address` is required. Both `address` and `indirect_address` may be specified when a CSR is accessible directly and indirectly.

|===

Custom Software Read::

| *value type*  | String of IDL code that returns a read value
| *description* | Function that returns the value of the CSR when read by software (i.e., a Zicsr instruction). If not specified, the value last written (possibly filtered through field `sw_write(csr_value)` functions) is returned.
|===

Fields::

[IMPORTANT] `fields` is a required key

|===
| *key*         | fields
| *value type*  | Mapping of field name (String) to field data (Object)
| *description* | Function that returns the value of the CSR when read by software (i.e., a Zicsr instruction). If not specified, the value last written (possibly filtered through field `sw_write(csr_value)` functions) is returned.
|===

== Schema for CSR fields

A CSR field definition is a mapping (_i.e._, hash, dictionary, ...) containing exactly one key
equal to the CSR field name, in uppercase, and pointing to an object specified below.

Location::

[IMPORTANT] `location` is required *unless* the location is dependent on the XLEN of a certain mode, in which case both `location_rv32` and `location_rv64` are required

|===
| *key*         | location
| *value type*  | Integer (when the field is a single bit) -OR- a String of "MSB-LSB"
| *description* | Location of the field within the CSR.
|===

|===
| *key*         | location_rv32
| *value type*  | Integer (when the field is a single bit) -OR- a String of "MSB-LSB"
| *description* | Location of the field within the CSR in RV32.
|===

|===
| *key*         | location_rv64
| *value type*  | Integer (when the field is a single bit) -OR- a String of "MSB-LSB"
| *description* | Location of the field within the CSR in RV64.
|===

Base::

When a CSR field is only present in RV32 or RV64, the `base` field is used.

|===
| *key*         | base
| *value type*  | One of [32, 64]
| *description* | Effective XLEN for this field to exist.
|===

Reset Value::

[IMPORTANT] `reset_value` is required *unless* the reset value is dependent on a configuration option, in which case `reset_value()` is required.

|===
| *key*         | reset_value
| *value type*  | Integer -OR- "UNDEFINED_LEGAL"
| *description* | Value of the field coming out of reset. When the specific value is not defined, "UNDEFINED_LEGAL" is use to indicate that the value isn't known but is guaranteed to a legal value for the field.
|===

|===
| *key*         | reset_value()
| *value type*  | String of IDL code that returns a reset value
| *description* | Value of the field coming out of reset. When the specific value is not defined, the special value UNDEFINED_LEGAL can be returned to indicate that the value isn't known but is guaranteed to a legal value for the field.
|===

Type::

[IMPORTANT] `type` is required, unless the type is configuration-dependent, in which case `type()` is required

Each field specifies a type as one of:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Type | Meaning

| *RO* | Read-only
| *RO-H* | Read-only, and hardware updates the field
| *RW* | Read-write
| *RW-R* | Read-write, but only a restricted set of values are allowed
| *RW-H* | Read-write, and hardware updates the field
| *RW-RH* | Read-write, only a restricted set of values are allowed, and hardware updates the field
|===

|===
| *key*         | type
| *value type*  | One of ["RO", "RO-H", "RW", "RW-R", "RW-H", "RW-RH"]
| *description* | The type of the field, as described above
|===

|===
| *key*         | type()
| *value type*  | String of IDL code that returns a CsrFieldType
| *description* | Type of the field, as a CsrFieldType enum value
|===

Custom Write Function::

[IMPORTANT] `sw_write(csr_value)` is required when the type of the field is restricted ("RW-R" or "RW-RH")

|===
| *key*         | sw_write(csr_value)
| *value type*  | String of IDL code that is run when the software writes the field
| *description* | Function implementing custom write behavior for the CSR. The csr_value parameter is the *entire* attempted CSR write value. Fields within the attempted write value can be accessed with a dot operator (e.g., csr_value.SXL, csr_value.VGEIN, ...)
|===

|===
| *key*         | legal?(csr_value)
| *value type*  | String of IDL code that returns whether or not an attempted write is legal
| *description* | Function that returns whether or not an attempted value for the field is legal. The csr_value parameter is the *entire* attempted CSR write value. Fields within the attempted write value can be accessed with a dot operator (e.g., csr_value.SXL, csr_value.VGEIN, ...)
|===

Alias::

Some fields are aliases for another field, often in a different CSR. THe `alias` key is used to indicate that this field just points somewhere else.
