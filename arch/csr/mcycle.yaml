description: |
  Counts the number of clock cycles executed by the processor core on which
  the hart is running.
  The counter has 64-bit precision on all RV32 and RV64 harts.

  The `mcycle` CSR may be shared between harts on the same core, in which case
  writes to `mcycle` will be visible to those harts. The platform should provide
  a mechanism to indicate which harts share an `mcycle` CSR.
