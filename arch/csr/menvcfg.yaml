    Contains bits to enable/disable extensions

    The `menvcfg` CSR controls
    certain characteristics of the execution environment for modes less
    privileged than M.

    If bit FIOM (Fence of I/O implies Memory) is set to one in `menvcfg`,
    FENCE instructions executed in modes less privileged than M are modified
    so the requirement to order accesses to device I/O implies also the
    requirement to order main memory accesses. <<menvcfg-FIOM>>
    details the modified interpretation of FENCE instruction bits PI, PO,
    SI, and SO for modes less privileged than M when FIOM=1.

    Similarly, for modes less privileged than M when FIOM=1, if an atomic
    instruction that accesses a region ordered as device I/O has its _aq_
    and/or _rl_ bit set, then that instruction is ordered as though it
    accesses both device I/O and memory.

    If S-mode is not supported, or if `satp`.MODE is read-only zero (always
    Bare), the implementation may make FIOM read-only zero.

    [NOTE]
    ====
    Bit FIOM is needed in `menvcfg` so M-mode can emulate the `H` (hypervisor)
    extension, which has an
    equivalent FIOM bit in the hypervisor CSR `henvcfg`.
    ====

    The PBMTE bit controls whether the Svpbmt extension is available for use
    in S-mode and G-stage address translation (i.e., for page tables pointed
    to by `satp` or `hgatp`). When PBMTE=1, Svpbmt is available for S-mode
    and G-stage address translation. When PBMTE=0, the implementation
    behaves as though Svpbmt were not implemented. If Svpbmt is not
    implemented, PBMTE is read-only zero. Furthermore, for implementations
    with the hypervisor extension, `henvcfg`.PBMTE is read-only zero if
    `menvcfg`.PBMTE is zero.

    After changing `menvcfg`.PBMTE, executing an SFENCE.VMA instruction with
    _rs1_=`x0` and _rs2_=`x0` suffices to synchronize address-translation caches
    with respect to the altered interpretation of page-table entries' PBMT fields.
    See <<hyp-mm-fences>> for additional synchronization requirements when the
    hypervisor extension is implemented.

    If the Svadu extension is implemented, the ADUE bit controls whether hardware
    updating of PTE A/D bits is enabled for S-mode and G-stage address
    translations.
    When ADUE=1, hardware updating of PTE A/D bits is enabled during S-mode
    address translation, and the implementation behaves as though the Svade
    extension were not implemented for S-mode address translation.
    When the hypervisor extension is implemented, if ADUE=1, hardware updating of
    PTE A/D bits is enabled during G-stage address translation, and the
    implementation behaves as though the Svade extension were not implemented for
    G-stage address translation.
    When ADUE=0, the implementation behaves as though Svade were implemented for
    S-mode and G-stage address translation.
    If Svadu is not implemented, ADUE is read-only zero.
    Furthermore, for implementations with the hypervisor extension, `henvcfg`.ADUE
    is read-only zero if `menvcfg`.ADUE is zero.

    NOTE: The Svade extension requires page-fault exceptions be raised when PTE
    A/D bits need be set, hence Svade is implemented when ADUE=0.

    If the Smcdeleg extension is implemented, the CDE (Counter Delegation Enable) bit controls whether Zicntr and Zihpm counters can be delegated to S-mode. When CDE=1, the Smcdeleg extension is enabled, see <<smcdeleg>>. When CDE=0, the Smcdeleg and Ssccfg extensions appear to be not implemented. If Smcdeleg is not implemented, CDE is read-only zero.

    The definition of the STCE field is furnished by the Sstc extension.

    The definition of the CBZE field is furnished by the Zicboz extension.

    The definitions of the CBCFE and CBIE fields are furnished by the Zicbom extension.

    The definition of the PMM field will be furnished by the forthcoming
    Smnpm extension. Its allocation within `menvcfg` may change prior to the
    ratification of that extension.

    The Zicfilp extension adds the `LPE` field in `menvcfg`. When the `LPE` field is
    set to 1 and S-mode is implemented, the Zicfilp extension is enabled in S-mode.
    If `LPE` field is set to 1 and S-mode is not implemented, the Zicfilp extension
    is enabled in U-mode. When the `LPE` field is 0, the Zicfilp extension is not
    enabled in S-mode, and the following rules apply to S-mode. If the `LPE` field
    is 0 and S-mode is not implemented, then the same rules apply to U-mode.

    * The hart does not update the `ELP` state; it remains as `NO_LP_EXPECTED`.
    * The `LPAD` instruction operates as a no-op.

    The Zicfiss extension adds the `SSE` field to `menvcfg`. When the `SSE` field is
    set to 1 the Zicfiss extension is activated in S-mode. When `SSE` field is 0,
    the following rules apply to privilege modes that are less than M:

    * 32-bit Zicfiss instructions will revert to their behavior as defined by Zimop.
    * 16-bit Zicfiss instructions will revert to their behavior as defined by Zcmop.
    * The `pte.xwr=010b` encoding in VS/S-stage page tables becomes reserved.
    * The `henvcfg.SSE` and `senvcfg.SSE` fields will read as zero and are read-only.
    * `SSAMOSWAP.W/D` raises an illegal-instruction exception.

    The Ssdbltrp extension adds the double-trap-enable (`DTE`) field in `menvcfg`.
    When `menvcfg.DTE` is zero, the implementation behaves as though Ssdbltrp is not
    implemented. When Ssdbltrp is not implemented `sstatus.SDT`, `vsstatus.SDT`, and
    `henvcfg.DTE` bits are read-only zero.

    When XLEN=32, `menvcfgh` is a 32-bit read/write register
    that aliases bits 63:32 of `menvcfg`.
    The `menvcfgh` register does not exist when XLEN=64.

    If U-mode is not supported, then registers `menvcfg` and `menvcfgh` do
    not exist.

        *STimecmp Enable*

        When set, `stimecmp` is operational.

        When clear, `stimecmp` access in a mode other than M-mode raises an `Illegal Instruction` trap.
        S-mode timer interrupts will not be generated when clear, and `mip` and `sip` revert to their prior behavior without `Sstc`.

        Furthermore, henvcfg.PBMTE is read-only zero if

        After changing `menvcfg.PBMTE`, executing an `sfence.vma` instruction with _rs1_=_x0_ and
        _rs2_=_x0_ suffices to synchronize address-translation caches with respect to the altered
        interpretation of page-table entries' PBMT fields.
