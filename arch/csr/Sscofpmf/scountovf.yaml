description: |
  A 32-bit read-only
  register that contains shadow copies of the OF bits in the 29 `mhpmevent` CSRs
  (`mhpmevent3` - `mhpmevent31`) — where `scountovf` bit X corresponds to `mhpmeventX`.

  This register enables supervisor-level overflow interrupt handler
  software to quickly and easily determine which counter(s) have overflowed
  (without needing to make an execution environment call or series of calls ultimately up to M-mode).

  Read access to bit X is subject to the same `mcounteren` (or `mcounteren` and `hcounteren`)
  CSRs that mediate access to the `hpmcounter` CSRs by S-mode (or VS-mode).
  In M-mode, `scountovf` bit X is always readable. In S/HS-mode, `scountovf` bit X is readable
  when `mcounteren` bit X is set, and otherwise reads as zero. Similarly, in VS mode,
  `scountovf` bit X is readable when `mcounteren` bit X and `hcounteren` bit X are both set, and otherwise reads as zero.
