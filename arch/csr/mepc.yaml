      description: |
        When a trap is taken into M-mode, `mepc.PC` is written with the virtual address of the
        instruction that was interrupted or that encountered the exception.
        Otherwise, `mepc.PC` is never written by the implementation, though it may be explicitly written
        by software.

        On an exception retun from M-mode (from the MRET instruction),
        control transfers to the virtual address read out of `mepc.PC`.

        Because PCs are always <% if ext?(:C) %>halfword<% else %>word<% end %>-aligned,
        <% if ext?(:C) %>bit 0<% else %>bits 1:0<% end %> of `mepc.PC` are always
        read-only 0.

        <% if ext?(:C) && MUTABLE_MISA_C %>
        When `misa.C` is clear, bit 1 is masked to zero. Writes to bit 1 are still captured, and
        may be visible on the next read with `misa.C` is set.
