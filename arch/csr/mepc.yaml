    Written with the PC of an instruction on an exception or interrupt taken in M-mode.

    Also controls where the hart jumps on an exception return from M-mode.

        When a trap is taken into M-mode, `mepc.PC` is written with the virtual address of the
        instruction that was interrupted or that encountered the exception.
        Otherwise, `mepc.PC` is never written by the implementation, though it may be explicitly written
        by software.

        On an exception retun from M-mode (from the MRET instruction),
        control transfers to the virtual address read out of `mepc.PC`.

        [when,"ext?(:C)"]
        Because PCs are always halfword-aligned, bit 0 of `mepc.PC` is always
        read-only 0.

        [when,"!ext?(:C)"]
        Because PCs are always word-aligned, bits 1:0 of `mepc.PC` are always
        read-only 0.

        [when,"ext?(:C) && MUTABLE_MISA_C == true"]
        When `misa.C` is clear, bit 1 is masked to zero. Writes to bit 1 are still captured, and
        may be visible on the next read with `misa.C` is set.
