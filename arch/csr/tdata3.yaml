  This register provides access to the trigger selected by tselect. 
  The reset values listed here apply to every underlying trigger.
  
  Trigger-specific data. It is optional if no implemented triggers use it.
  If the trigger is disabled, then this register can be written with any value 
  supported by any of the trigger types supported by this trigger.
  If XLEN is less than DXLEN, writes to this register are sign-extended. 
  
  This CSR is read/write.
