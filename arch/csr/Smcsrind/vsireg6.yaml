  The `vsireg6` CSR is the final alias in the virtual supervisor-level set of
  indirect access CSRs. Like its counterparts, it is accessed indirectly through
  the `vsiselect` CSR and provides a data window into a selected register.

  For 64-bit register arrays in RV32 environments, `vsireg6` may be used for
  accessing the upper 32 bits, while lower aliases such as `vsireg3` provide the
  corresponding lower half.

  Access to `vsireg6` while `vsiselect` holds an unsupported value is
  UNSPECIFIED. Virtual instruction exceptions are recommended for unsupported
  access cases.
