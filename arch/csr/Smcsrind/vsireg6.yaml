  The `vsireg6` CSR is part of the virtual supervisor-level indirect register access
  mechanism. It is used for accessing register state based on the value held in the
  `vsiselect` CSR. `vsireg6` acts as one of the alias registers in the system, providing
  indirect access to a register selected via `vsiselect`.

  In RV32 environments, `vsireg6` is typically used for accessing the upper 32 bits of
  a 64-bit register array, while other aliases, such as `vsireg3`, provide access to
  the lower 32 bits.

  When `vsiselect` holds an unimplemented value, the behavior of accesses to `vsireg6`
  is UNSPECIFIED. Implementations are encouraged to raise a virtual instruction exception
  to support emulation or error handling.
