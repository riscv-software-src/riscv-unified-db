  The `mireg5` CSR is an alias register for accessing indirect registers that
  are selected by the `miselect` CSR. The value of `miselect` determines which
  register is accessed during read or write operations.

  The `mireg5` CSR is used for indirect access to machine-level registers.
  The access to these registers depends on the value in the `miselect` CSR.

  If `miselect` selects this register, the data can be read or written using this CSR.
