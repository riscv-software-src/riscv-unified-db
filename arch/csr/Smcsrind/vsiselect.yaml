  The `vsiselect` register will support the value range 0..0xFFF at a minimum. A future extension may
  define a value range outside of this minimum range. Only if such an extension is implemented will
  `vsiselect` be required to support larger values.

  Requiring a range of 0-0xFFF for `vsiselect`, even though most or all of the space may be reserved
  or inaccessible, permits a hypervisor to emulate indirectly accessed registers in this implemented
  range, including registers that may be standardized in the future.

  More generally it is recommended that `vsiselect` and `siselect` be implemented with the same number
  of bits. This also avoids creation of a virtualization hole due to observable differences between
  `vsiselect` and `siselect` widths.

  Values of `vsiselect` with the most-significant bit set (bit XLEN - 1 = 1) are designated only for
  custom use, presumably for accessing custom registers through the alias CSRs. Values of `vsiselect`
  with the most-significant bit clear are designated only for standard use and are reserved until
  allocated to a standard architecture extension. If XLEN is changed, the most-significant bit of
  `vsiselect` moves to the new position, retaining its value from before.
