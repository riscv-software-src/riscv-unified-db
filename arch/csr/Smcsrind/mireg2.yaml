description: |
  The `mireg2` CSR is an indirect alias register used for machine-level access to register state,
  indexed via the value in `miselect`.

  Like `mireg`, this CSR enables flexible access to an array of registers without allocating
  dedicated CSR numbers for each. It may be used independently or as part of a split-access
  scheme for larger registers in RV32.

  The behavior of `mireg2` is determined by the value of `miselect`. If `miselect` holds
  an unsupported value, the behavior is UNSPECIFIED.
