description: |
  The `mireg2` CSR is a machine-level indirect alias register used to access
  register state as determined by the value in `miselect`. This CSR allows
  flexible access to an array of registers without requiring dedicated CSR
  numbers for each.

  The behavior of `mireg2` is determined by the value in `miselect`. If the
  value in `miselect` is not implemented, access is UNSPECIFIED, and it is
  encouraged that implementations raise an illegal instruction exception in such cases.

  VALUE:
    location_rv32: 31-0
