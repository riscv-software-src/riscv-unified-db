      The CSRs listed in the table above provide a window for accessing register state indirectly.
      The value of `miselect` determines which register is accessed upon read or write of each of
      the machine indirect alias CSRs (`mireg*`). `miselect` value ranges are allocated to dependent
      extensions, which specify the register state accessible via each `miregi` register, for each
      `miselect` value. `miselect` is a WARL register.

  - id: csr-miselect-implemented-bits
    normative: true
    text: |
      The `miselect` register implements at least enough bits to support all implemented `miselect`
      values (corresponding to the implemented extensions that utilize `miselect`/`mireg*` to
      indirectly access register state). The `miselect` register may be read-only zero if there are
      no extensions implemented that utilize it.

  - id: csr-miselect-custom-standard-bit
    normative: true
    text: |
      Values of `miselect` with the most-significant bit set (bit XLEN - 1 = 1) are designated only for
      custom use, presumably for accessing custom registers through the alias CSRs. Values of
      `miselect` with the most-significant bit clear are designated only for standard use and are
      reserved until allocated to a standard architecture extension.

  - id: csr-miselect-msb-stability
    normative: true
    text: |
      If XLEN is changed, the most-significant bit of `miselect` moves to the new position,
      retaining its value from before.

  - id: csr-miselect-no-custom-support
    normative: false
    text: |
      An implementation is not required to support any custom values for `miselect`.
