description: |
  The `miselect` CSR is a register used to select the indirect registers that
  can be accessed using the `mireg*` aliases. The value of this register
  determines which indirect register is accessed during read or write operations.

  The values of `miselect` define the indirect registers accessible via
  `mireg*`. The valid values are allocated by the extension that implements
  indirect access. The most significant bit is reserved for custom usage.
  It is recommended that a value of 0 corresponds to a standard set of
  indirect register aliases.

  The indirect access mechanism enables a more efficient method to access
  registers without needing to reserve large chunks of CSR address space.
  Implementations should ensure that accesses to `miselect` with unsupported
  values result in an illegal instruction exception.
