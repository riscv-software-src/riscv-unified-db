description: |
  The `miselect` CSR is a WARL (Write-Any Read-Legal) register that selects which
  indirect register is accessed via the `mireg*` alias CSRs. The value in `miselect`
  acts as an index into a space of indirectly addressable machine-level registers.

  Values of `miselect` are allocated by extensions implementing indirect register access.
  The most-significant bit (bit MXLEN-1) is reserved for custom use and must be used
  only with implementation-specific extensions. Values with this bit clear are reserved
  for standard use.

  The indirect access mechanism enabled by `miselect` reduces the need for allocating
  large contiguous CSR address ranges by supporting register arrays accessed by index.

  If `miselect` holds an unsupported value, accesses to the corresponding `mireg*`
  alias CSR are UNSPECIFIED. Implementations are encouraged to raise an illegal instruction
  exception to support robust error handling and software emulation.
