description: |
  The `mireg6` CSR offers the final alias in the machine-level indirect access set, and is typically
  used for the upper half of a 64-bit register accessed via `mireg3` in RV32 environments.

  This CSR expands support for multiple register arrays, enabling extensions to define complex
  or high-bandwidth access patterns using a compact set of CSRs.

  When `miselect` holds a value not allocated or implemented by an extension, access is
  UNSPECIFIED and may raise an exception.

  Count:
    location_rv32: 31-0
    location_rv64: 63-0
