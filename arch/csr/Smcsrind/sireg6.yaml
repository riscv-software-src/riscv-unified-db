description: |
  The `sireg6` CSR is a supervisor-level alias register used to access register state
  indirectly based on the value held in the `siselect` CSR. The `sireg6` CSR provides
  access to a window of indirectly addressed registers.

  The behavior of accesses to `sireg6` is determined by the value of `siselect`.
  If `siselect` holds a value that corresponds to an implemented register,
  the register is accessed as determined by the value of `siselect`.

  When `siselect` holds an unsupported value, access to `sireg6` is UNSPECIFIED,
  and implementations are encouraged to raise an illegal instruction exception
  to facilitate debugging or software emulation.

  This indirect access mechanism allows efficient access to an array of CSRs
  without allocating large contiguous blocks of CSR address space. It is useful
  for arrays such as performance counters and other register sets.
