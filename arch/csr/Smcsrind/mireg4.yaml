description: |
  The `mireg4` CSR is commonly used to access the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit machine-level
  register in RV32 systems when used alongside `mireg`, `mireg2`, or `mireg3`.

  This split-access capability allows for indirect access to full 64-bit values in 32-bit environments
  using paired CSRs. The `miselect` value determines the exact register being accessed.

  If `miselect` points to an unimplemented mapping, behavior is UNSPECIFIED. It is
  RECOMMENDED to raise an illegal instruction exception.

  Count:
    location_rv32: 31-0
