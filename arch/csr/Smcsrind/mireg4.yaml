description: |
  The `mireg4` CSR is a machine-level indirect alias register used to access
  register state as determined by the value in `miselect`. This CSR provides
  access to a range of registers indirectly without requiring dedicated CSR
  numbers for each register.

  The behavior of `mireg4` is determined by the value of `miselect`. If the value
  in `miselect` is not implemented, access is UNSPECIFIED, and implementations
  are encouraged to raise an illegal instruction exception.
