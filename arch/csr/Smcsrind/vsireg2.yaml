description: |
  One of the virtual supervisor-level alias CSRs used for indirect register access.
  The value of `vsiselect` determines which register is accessed upon read or write
  of `vsireg2`.

  Value ranges of `vsiselect` are allocated to dependent extensions, which specify
  the register state accessible via each `vsiregi` register, for each `vsiselect` value.

  The behavior upon accessing `vsireg2` while `vsiselect` holds a value that is not
  implemented at HS level is UNSPECIFIED. It is RECOMMENDED that implementations raise
  a virtual instruction exception for such accesses, to facilitate possible emulation
  by M-mode or for error detection.
