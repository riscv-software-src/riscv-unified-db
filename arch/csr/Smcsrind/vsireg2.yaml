description: |
  The `vsireg2` CSR is one of the virtual supervisor-level alias registers used
  to indirectly access register state based on the value held in the `vsiselect`
  CSR. This aliasing mechanism provides a means for indexed access to an array
  of registers, reducing the need to reserve large, contiguous blocks of CSR
  address space.

  The value in `vsiselect` determines the behavior of `vsireg2`, including the
  register that is read or written. Each `vsireg*` CSR behaves as a data window
  to register state selected by the `vsiselect` index.

  If `vsiselect` holds a value that is not implemented, the behavior of `vsireg2`
  is UNSPECIFIED. Implementations are encouraged to raise a virtual instruction
  exception to support debugging and potential emulation.
