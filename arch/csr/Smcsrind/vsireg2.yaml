  The `vsireg2` CSR is one of several virtual supervisor-level alias registers used
  to indirectly access register state based on the value held in the `vsiselect`
  CSR. This alias mechanism enables efficient access to register state by indexing
  into an alias space defined by the extension utilizing this access method.

  The value in `vsiselect` determines the register being accessed through `vsireg2`.
  The `vsiselect` value serves as an index into a virtualized alias space, providing
  access to registers without consuming contiguous CSR address ranges.

  If `vsiselect` holds a value that is not implemented, the behavior of `vsireg2`
  is UNSPECIFIED. It is RECOMMENDED that implementations raise a virtual instruction
  exception for such accesses to facilitate debugging and emulation.

  The access behavior for each `vsiselect` + `vsireg2` pair is defined by the
  extension that owns the `vsiselect` value. Ordinarily, the alias register
  either accesses architectural state, reads zero, or raises an exception.
