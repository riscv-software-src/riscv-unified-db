  description: |
   The `mireg` CSR is the primary machine-level indirect alias register used to access
   register state as determined by the index held in `miselect`. This CSR is typically used
   to read or write the full 32-bit or 64-bit value of the indirectly addressed register.

   For 64-bit registers in RV32 systems, `mireg` is generally used to access the lower 32 bits.
   Combined with higher-indexed aliases (e.g., `mireg4`), this provides full access to 64-bit values
   across multiple CSRs.

   If the value in `miselect` is not implemented, access is UNSPECIFIED. Implementations
   are encouraged to raise an illegal instruction exception in such cases.
