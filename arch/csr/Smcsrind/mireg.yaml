description: |
  The `mireg` CSR is the machine-level indirect alias register used to access another
  CSR's state indirectly upon a read or write, as determined by the value in `miselect`.

  Accessing `mireg` when `miselect` holds a value that is not implemented results in
  UNSPECIFIED behavior. Implementations are encouraged to raise an illegal instruction
  exception in such cases, to help detect software bugs. Platform and profile specifications
  may impose additional requirements for such cases.

  When `miselect` holds a valid and implemented value, the behavior of `mireg` is defined
  by the extension to which that `miselect` value is allocated. Ordinarily, `mireg` will access
  register state, return read-only zero, or raise an illegal instruction exception.

  On RV32 systems, if an indirectly addressed register is 64 bits wide, it is recommended that
  the lower 32 bits are accessed through `mireg` and the upper 32 bits through `mireg4`.
