  The `vsireg4` CSR is a virtual supervisor-level alias register accessed
  indirectly via the `vsiselect` CSR. It is part of a set of CSRs that form a
  scalable mechanism for register array access without requiring dedicated
  address space for each individual register.

  In RV32 environments where a register may be 64-bit, `vsireg4` can be used
  to access the upper 32 bits of a split register, in conjunction with other
  alias CSRs such as `vsireg` or `vsireg2` for the lower bits.

  Accesses to `vsireg4` while `vsiselect` holds an unsupported value are
  UNSPECIFIED and should raise a virtual instruction exception.
