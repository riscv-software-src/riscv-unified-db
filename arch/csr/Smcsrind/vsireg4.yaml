  The `vsireg4` CSR is a virtual supervisor-level alias register used for indirect
  access to register state based on the value held in the `vsiselect` CSR. It is part of
  a set of alias registers that allow efficient access to register arrays in VS-mode without
  consuming large contiguous CSR address ranges.

  In RV32 environments, where registers may be 64-bit, `vsireg4` is typically used to
  access the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit register, in combination with other alias CSRs like
  `vsireg` and `vsireg2`, which handle the lower 32 bits.

  If the value in `vsiselect` is unsupported or unimplemented, access to `vsireg4` is
  UNSPECIFIED. Implementations are encouraged to raise a virtual instruction exception to
  facilitate debugging and software emulation.
