description: |
  The `sireg5` CSR is a supervisor-level alias register used to access register state
  indirectly based on the value held in the `siselect` CSR. The `sireg5` CSR provides
  access to a window of indirectly addressed registers.

  The behavior of accesses to `sireg5` is determined by the currently selected
  `siselect` value, which acts as an index into an alias space defined by the extension
  utilizing this access method. This indirect mechanism allows software to access
  an array of CSRs without consuming large contiguous blocks of the CSR address space.

  When `siselect` contains a value that is not supported, access to `sireg5` is UNSPECIFIED,
  and implementations are encouraged to raise an illegal instruction exception to aid in
  debugging or software emulation.

  The indirect access mechanism is useful for CSR arrays, such as counters or
  performance registers, and ensures a scalable way to interact with dynamically
  indexed register sets.
