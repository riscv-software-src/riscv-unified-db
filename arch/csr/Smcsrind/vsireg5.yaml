  The `vsireg5` CSR is part of the virtual supervisor-level indirect register access
  mechanism, providing indexed access to register state based on the value held in the
  `vsiselect` CSR. It enables software in VS-mode to access register arrays efficiently,
  avoiding the need to allocate large, contiguous CSR address ranges.

  When the `vsiselect` value points to an unimplemented register, access to `vsireg5`
  is UNSPECIFIED. Implementations are encouraged to raise a virtual instruction exception
  to support software emulation or error handling.
