  The `vsireg5` CSR is an alias used in the virtual supervisor-level indirect
  register access model. It provides indexed access to register state based on
  the currently selected value in `vsiselect`.

  This CSR, along with other `vsireg*` aliases, helps provide consistent access
  patterns to extended register arrays while maintaining efficient usage of the
  limited CSR address space.

  If the selected `vsiselect` value is not implemented, behavior is
  UNSPECIFIED, and it is recommended that a virtual instruction exception be
  raised.
