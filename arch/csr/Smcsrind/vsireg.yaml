  The `vsireg` CSR is one of several alias registers used to indirectly access
  virtual supervisor-level CSRs in VS-mode or VU-mode. The register addressed by
  `vsireg` is selected by the current value of the `vsiselect` CSR. The alias
  mechanism allows indirect CSR access, which helps in virtualization and future
  extensibility.

  A virtual instruction exception is raised for attempts from VS-mode or VU-mode
  to directly access `vsiselect` or `vsireg`, or from VU-mode to access
  `siselect` or `sireg`.

  The behavior of accesses to `vsireg` when `vsiselect` holds a value that is
  not implemented at the HS level is UNSPECIFIED, but implementations are
  recommended to raise an illegal instruction exception for such accesses.

  The width of `vsireg` is always the current `XLEN`, not `VSXLEN`. For example,
  if `HSXLEN = 64` and `VSXLEN = 32`, then `vsireg` is 64 bits wide when
  accessed from HS-mode (RV64), but 32 bits when accessed from VS-mode (RV32).
