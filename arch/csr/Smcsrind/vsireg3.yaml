description: |
  The `vsireg3` CSR is part of the virtual supervisor-level indirect access
  mechanism and serves as one of the alias registers indexed by the `vsiselect`
  CSR.

  The indirect CSR access model enables software in VS-mode to interact with
  register arrays using a select value, improving scalability and reducing CSR
  address space consumption.

  When `vsiselect` holds an unimplemented value, accesses to `vsireg3` are
  UNSPECIFIED, and it is recommended that implementations raise a virtual
  instruction exception to facilitate software emulation or trap-based
  handling.
