  The `vsireg3` CSR is a virtual supervisor-level alias register used to indirectly
  access register state based on the value held in the `vsiselect` CSR. This CSR
  forms part of the virtualized alias register space, enabling efficient access to
  register arrays in VS-mode without consuming large contiguous CSR address ranges.

  The value of `vsiselect` determines which register is accessed via `vsireg3`.
  The `vsiselect` CSR acts as an index into the alias space, facilitating scalable
  access to a range of registers.

  If `vsiselect` holds a value that is not implemented, the behavior of `vsireg3`
  is UNSPECIFIED. It is recommended that implementations raise a virtual instruction
  exception in such cases to support debugging and software emulation.
