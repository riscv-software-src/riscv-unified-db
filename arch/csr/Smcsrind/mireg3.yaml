description: |
  The `mireg3` machine indirect alias CSR is used to access register state indirectly
  upon a read or write, as determined by the value of `miselect`.

  The behavior upon accessing `mireg3` from M-mode, while `miselect` holds a value
  that is not implemented, is UNSPECIFIED.

  [Note]
    It is expected that implementations will typically raise an illegal instruction exception for
    such accesses, so that, for example, they can be identified as software bugs. Platform
    specs, profile specs, and/or the Privileged ISA spec may place more restrictions on
    behavior for such accesses.

  Attempts to access `mireg3` while `miselect` holds a number in an allocated and implemented
  range results in a specific behavior that, for each combination of `miselect` and `mireg3`, is
  defined by the extension to which the `miselect` value is allocated.

  [Note]
    Ordinarily, `mireg3` will access register state, access read-only 0 state, or raise an
    illegal instruction exception.

  [Note]
    For RV32, if an extension defines an indirectly accessed register as 64 bits wide, it is
    recommended that the lower 32 bits of the register are accessed through `mireg3`,
    while the upper 32 bits are accessed through `mireg6`.
