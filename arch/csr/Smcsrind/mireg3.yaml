description: |
  The `mireg3` CSR provides an additional machine-level alias for indirect register access via
  the `miselect` CSR. This CSR supports cases where multiple register arrays or channels need
  to be addressed concurrently.

  In RV32, `mireg3` may be used as part of an array access pattern to read or write lower
  segments of a register, or to support separate CSR sets.

  Access behavior is defined by the selected value in `miselect`. Unsupported values result in
  UNSPECIFIED behavior and may raise an illegal instruction exception.

  Count:
    location_rv32: 31-0
