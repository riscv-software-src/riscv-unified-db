description: |
  The `mviph` CSR contains the upper 32 bits of the `mvip` CSR and is accessible on RV32 systems when `S-mode` is implemented.
  It complements the lower 32 bits in `mvip` to provide full access to all 64 virtual interrupt-pending bits.

  This CSR allows software running in M-mode to access or modify the upper portion of virtual interrupt-pending state for supervisor-level interrupts.

    description: |
      Upper 32 bits [63:32] of the `mvip` register. Represents virtual interrupt-pending bits
      for supervisor-level interrupts. Behavior and meaning of these bits are determined by implementation and `mvien`.
