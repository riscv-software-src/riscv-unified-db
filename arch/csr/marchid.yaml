  description: |
    The `marchid` CSR is an MXLEN-bit read-only register encoding the base
    microarchitecture of the hart. This register must be readable in any
    implementation, but a value of 0 can be returned to indicate the field
    is not implemented. The combination of `mvendorid` and `marchid` should
    uniquely identify the type of hart microarchitecture that is
    implemented.

    Open-source project architecture IDs are allocated globally by RISC-V
    International, and have non-zero architecture IDs with a zero
    most-significant-bit (MSB). Commercial architecture IDs are allocated by
    each commercial vendor independently, but must have the MSB set and
    cannot contain zero in the remaining MXLEN-1 bits.

    [NOTE]
    ====
    The intent is for the architecture ID to represent the microarchitecture
    associated with the repo around which development occurs rather than a
    particular organization. Commercial fabrications of open-source designs
    should (and might be required by the license to) retain the original
    architecture ID. This will aid in reducing fragmentation and tool
    support costs, as well as provide attribution. Open-source architecture
    IDs are administered by RISC-V International and should only be
    allocated to released, functioning open-source projects. Commercial
    architecture IDs can be managed independently by any registered vendor
    but are required to have IDs disjoint from the open-source architecture
    IDs (MSB set) to prevent collisions if a vendor wishes to use both
    closed-source and open-source microarchitectures.

    The convention adopted within the following Implementation field can be
    used to segregate branches of the same architecture design, including by
    organization. The `misa` register also helps distinguish different
    variants of a design.
