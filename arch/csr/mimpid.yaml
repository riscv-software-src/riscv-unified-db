    Reports the vendor-specific implementation ID.

    The `mimpid` CSR provides a unique encoding of the version of the
    processor implementation. This register must be readable in any
    implementation, but a value of 0 can be returned to indicate that the
    field is not implemented. The Implementation value should reflect the
    design of the RISC-V processor itself and not any surrounding system.

    [NOTE]
    ====
    The format of this field is left to the provider of the architecture
    source code, but will often be printed by standard tools as a
    hexadecimal string without any leading or trailing zeros, so the
    Implementation value can be left-justified (i.e., filled in from
    most-significant nibble down) with subfields aligned on nibble
    boundaries to ease human readability.
