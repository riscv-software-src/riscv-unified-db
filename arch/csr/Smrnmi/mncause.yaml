  The mncause CSR holds the reason for the NMI.
  If the reason is an interrupt, bit MXLEN-1 is set to 1, and the NMI cause is encoded in
  the least-significant bits.
  If the reason is an interrupt and NMI causes are not supported,
  bit MXLEN-1 is set to 1, and zero is written to the least-significant bits.
  If the reason is an exception within M-mode that results in a double trap as
  specified in the Smdbltrp extension, bit MXLEN-1 is set to 0 and the least-significant
  bits are set to the cause code corresponding to the exception that precipitated the
  double trap.

      Written by hardware when a resumable NMI is taken into M-mode.

      When set, the last non-maskable exception was caused by an asynchronous Interrupt.

      [when,"TRAP_ON_ILLEGAL_WLRL == true"]
      If `mcause` is written with an undefined cause (combination of `mcause.INT` and `mcause.CODE`), an `Illegal Instruction` exception occurs.

      [when,"TRAP_ON_ILLEGAL_WLRL == false"]
      If `mcause` is written with an undefined cause (combination of `mcause.INT` and `mcause.CODE`), neither `mcause.INT` nor `mcause.CODE` are modified.
