    Controls exception delegation from M-mode to HS/S-mode

    By default, all traps at any privilege level are handled in machine
    mode, though a machine-mode handler can redirect traps back to the
    appropriate level with the `MRET` instruction. To increase performance,
    implementations can provide individual read/write bits within `mideleg`
    to indicate that certain exceptions and interrupts should
    be processed directly by a lower privilege level. 

    In harts with S-mode, the `mideleg` register must
    exist, and setting a bit `mideleg` will delegate the
    corresponding trap, when occurring in S-mode or U-mode, to the S-mode
    trap handler
    <%- if ext?(:H) -%>
    (which could further be delegated to VS-mode through hideleg)
    <%- end -%>
    .
    <%- if ext?(:S, "> 1.9.1") -%>
    In harts without S-mode, the `mideleg` register should not exist.

    [NOTE]
    ====
    In versions 1.9.1 and earlier , this register existed but was
    hardwired to zero in M-mode only, or M/U without N harts. There is no
    reason to require they return zero in those cases, as the `misa`
    register indicates whether they exist.
    ====
    <%- else -%>
    In harts without S-mode, the `mideleg` register is read-only zero.
    <%- end -%>

    An implementation can choose to subset the delegatable traps, with the
    supported delegatable bits found by writing one to every bit location,
    then reading back the value in `mideleg` to see which bit
    positions hold a one.

    [NOTE]
    ====
    Version 1.11 and earlier prohibited having any bits of `mideleg` be
    read-only one. Platform standards may always add such restrictions.
    ====

    Traps never transition from a more-privileged mode to a less-privileged
    mode. For example, if M-mode has delegated illegal-instruction
    exceptions to S-mode, and M-mode software later executes an illegal
    instruction, the trap is taken in M-mode, rather than being delegated to
    S-mode. By contrast, traps may be taken horizontally. Using the same
    example, if M-mode has delegated illegal-instruction exceptions to
    S-mode, and S-mode software later executes an illegal instruction, the
    trap is taken in S-mode.

    Delegated interrupts result in the interrupt being masked at the
    delegator privilege level. For example, if the supervisor timer
    interrupt (STI) is delegated to S-mode by setting `mideleg`[5], STIs
    will not be taken when executing in M-mode. By contrast, if `mideleg`[5]
    is clear, STIs can be taken in any mode and regardless of current mode
    will transfer control to M-mode.

    `mideleg` holds trap delegation bits for individual interrupts, with the
    layout of bits matching those in the `mip` register (i.e., STIP
    interrupt delegation control is located in bit 5).

    For exceptions that cannot occur in less privileged modes, the
    corresponding `medeleg` bits should be read-only zero. In particular,
    `medeleg`[11] is read-only zero.

    <%- if ext?(:Smdbltrp) || ext?(:Ssdbltrp) -%>
    The `medeleg`[16] is read-only zero as double trap is not delegatable.
    <%- end -%>
