  This optional register is an alias for `scontext`. It is only
  accessible in S/HS-mode, M-mode and Debug Mode. It is included
  for backward compatibility with version 0.13.

  The encoding of this CSR does not conform to the CSR Address
  Mapping Convention in the Privileged Spec. It is expected that
  new implementations will not support this encoding and that new
  debuggers will not use this CSR if `scontext` is available.

      Supervisor mode software can write a context number to
      this register, which can be used to set triggers that only fire
      in that specific context.
      An implementation may tie any number of high bits in
      this field to 0. It’s recommended to implement 16 bits on
      RV32 and 32 bits on RV64.
