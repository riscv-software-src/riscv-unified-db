        *Machine Previous Virtualization mode*

        Written with the prior virtualization mode when entering M-mode from an exception/interrupt.
        When returning via an MRET instruction, the virtualization mode becomes the value of MPV unless MPP=3, in which case the virtualization mode is always 0.
        Can also be written by software.
