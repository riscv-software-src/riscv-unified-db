  The `htimedelta` CSR is a 64-bit read/write register that contains the delta
  between the value of the `time` CSR and the value returned in VS-mode or VU-mode.
  That is, reading the `time` CSR in VS or VU mode returns the sum of the contents
  of `htimedelta` and the actual value of `time`.

  [NOTE]
  Because overflow is ignored when summing `htimedelta` and `time`, large values of
  `htimedelta` may be used to represent negative time offsets.
