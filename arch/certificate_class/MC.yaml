name: MC
long_name: Microcontroller Certificate Class

introduction: |
  This certification class specifies requirements for microcontrollers.
  It targets microcontrollers running low-level software on an RTOS or bare-metal.
  This CRD is not intended for the smallest possible microcontrollers but rather for applications
  benefiting from a standardized microcontroller.
  See the https://docs.google.com/document/d/133SZKc18tLsQcT1o6gEmBUkjwrtg2ow63me54RQ1jiY[RISC-V CRDs]
  document for information relevant to all RISC-V CRDs.

naming_scheme: |
  The MC (M = Microcontroller, C = Certificate) has the following naming scheme (suffixes after MC
  are optional but in the below order):

    MC<model>[v<version>]

  Where:

  * Left & right square braces denote optional. 
  * \<model> is a 3 digit integer. It is changed only when mandatory extensions are added to a CRD.
  ** The one's digit is incremented when a small mandatory extension is added (e.g., Zicond)
  ** The ten's digit is incremented when a medium mandatory extension is addded (e.g., PMP)
  ** The hundreds's digit is incremented when a large mandatory extension is addded (e.g., V or H)
  * \<version> is a semantic version (see semver.org) formatted as <major>[.<minor>.[patch]]. If \<version> is omitted, the reference applies equally to all versions. 
  ** A <major> release indicates support for a new optional extension.
  ** A <minor> release indicates one or more of the following changes to the certification tests associated with the CRD.
  *** Fix test bug or increase test coverage
  *** Add more allowed parameter values
  *** Support new extension version
  ** A <patch> release indicates just CRD specification changes without any difference in functional behavior
