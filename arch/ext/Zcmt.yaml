kind: extension
name: Zcmt
long_name: 16-bit Table Jump
description: |
  Zcmt adds the table jump instructions and also adds the jvt CSR. The jvt CSR requires a
  state enable if Smstateen is implemented. See <<csrs-jvt>> for details.

  This extension reuses some encodings from _c.fsdsp_.  Therefore it is _incompatible_ with <<Zcd>>,
   which is included when C and D extensions are both present.

  NOTE: Zcmt is primarily targeted at embedded class CPUs due to implementation complexity. Additionally, it is not compatible with RVA profiles.

  The Zcmt extension depends on the <<Zca>> and Zicsr extensions.
