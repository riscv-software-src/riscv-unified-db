  The B standard extension comprises instructions provided by the `Zba`, `Zbb`, and `Zbs` extensions.

  Bit 1 of the `misa` register encodes the presence of the B standard extension. When `misa.B` is 1,
  the implementation supports the instructions provided by the `Zba`, `Zbb`, and `Zbs` extensions.
  When `misa.B` is 0, it indicates that the implementation may not support one or more of the
  `Zba`, `Zbb`, or `Zbs` extensions.
params:
  MUTABLE_MISA_B:
    description: |
      Indicates whether or not the `B` extension can be disabled with the `misa.B` bit.
