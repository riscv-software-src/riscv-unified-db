  description: |
    The B standard extension comprises instructions provided by the `Zba`, `Zbb`, and `Zbs` extensions.

    Bit 1 of the `misa` register encodes the presence of the B standard extension. When `misa.B` is 1,
    the implementation supports the instructions provided by the `Zba`, `Zbb`, and `Zbs` extensions.
    When `misa.B` is 0, it indicates that the implementation may not support one or more of the
    `Zba`, `Zbb`, or `Zbs` extensions.
