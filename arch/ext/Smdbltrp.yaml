long_name: Double trap
description: |
  The `Smdbltrp` extension addresses a double trap in M-mode.
  When the `Smrnmi` extension is implemented, it enables invocation of the RNMI handler on a
  double trap in M-mode to handle the critical error.
  If the `Smrnmi` extension is not implemented or if a double trap occurs during the RNMI
  handler's execution, this extension helps transition the hart to a critical error state and
  enables signaling the critical error to the platform.

  To improve error diagnosis and resolution, this extension supports debugging harts in a critical
  error state. The extension introduces a mechanism to enter Debug Mode instead of asserting a
  critical-error signal to the platform when the hart is in a critical error state.
