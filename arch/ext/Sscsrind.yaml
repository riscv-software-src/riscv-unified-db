long_name: Supervisor Indirect CSR Access (Sscsrind)
description: |
  The `Sscsrind` extension extends the CSR access mechanism for Supervisor mode by enabling indirect
  access to Supervisor-level registers through the `siselect` CSR. This extension provides efficient access
  to an array of registers without allocating large contiguous blocks of CSR address space. Registers are
  accessed by index, offering a more scalable approach to managing Supervisor-level registers.

  Similar to the `Smcsrind` extension, this mechanism reduces the need for fixed CSR numbers, supporting
  custom extensions that manage Supervisor-level register access through the use of `siselect` and `sireg*`
  registers.
