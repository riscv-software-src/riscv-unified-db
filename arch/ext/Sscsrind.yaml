long_name: Supervisor Indirect CSR Access (Sscsrind)
description: |
  The `Sscsrind` extension extends the CSR access mechanism for Supervisor mode by enabling indirect
  access to a set of registers. Similar to `Smcsrind`, this extension allows registers to be accessed through
  an index value (`siselect`) instead of using fixed CSR numbers. This flexibility helps manage the CSR space
  efficiently and provides a more scalable mechanism for accessing supervisor-level registers.

  `Sscsrind` registers are accessed indirectly via dedicated `siselect` and `sireg*` registers, providing
  software with the ability to access an array of registers by index. This extension is essential for handling
  large numbers of registers and reduces the need for allocating large chunks of CSR address space for each
  individual register.

  While `Smcsrind` applies to machine-level access, `Sscsrind` targets Supervisor-level registers and behaves
  similarly, but with the exclusion of machine-level CSRs.
