name: Zvfhmin
long_name: Vector Extension for Minimal Half-Precision Floating-Point
description: |
  This extension provides minimal support for vectors of IEEE 754-2008
  binary16 values, adding conversions to and from binary32.
  When the Zvfhmin extension is implemented, the `vfwcvt.f.f.v` and
  `vfncvt.f.f.w` instructions become defined when SEW=16.
  The EEW=16 floating-point operands of these instructions use the binary16
  format.

  This extension depends on the Zve32f extension.
