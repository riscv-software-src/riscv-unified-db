    This chapter describes the standard integer multiplication and division
    instruction extension, which is named `M` and contains instructions
    that multiply or divide values held in two integer registers.

    [TIP]
    ====
    We separate integer multiply and divide out from the base to simplify
    low-end implementations, or for applications where integer multiply and
    divide operations are either infrequent or better handled in attached
    accelerators.
