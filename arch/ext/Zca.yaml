$schema: "ext_schema.json#"
kind: extension
name: Zca
long_name: C instructions excluding floating-point
description: |
  The Zca extension is added as way to refer to instructions in the `C` extension that do not
  include the floating-point loads and stores.

  Therefore it excludes all 16-bit floating point loads and stores:
  `c.flw`, `c.flwsp`, `c.fsw`, `c.fswsp`, `c.fld`, `c.fldsp`, `c.fsd`, `c.fsdsp`.

  [NOTE]
  The 'C' extension only includes `F`/`D` instructions when `D` and `F` are also specified.
