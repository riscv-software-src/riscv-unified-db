description:
  - id: ext-zhinx-instructions
    normative: true
    text: |
      The Zhinx extension adds all of the instructions that the Zfh extension adds, except for the
      transfer instructions FLH, FSH, FMV.H.X, and FMV.X.H.

  - id: ext-zhinx-semantics
    normative: true
    text: |
      The Zhinx variants of these Zfh-extension instructions have the same semantics, except that
      whenever such an instruction would have accessed an f register, it instead accesses the x
      register with the same number.
