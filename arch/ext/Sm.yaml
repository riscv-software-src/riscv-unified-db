  type: privileged
  long_name: Machine mode
  versions:
  - version: "1.11.0"
    state: ratified
    ratification_date: 2019-12
    changes:
    - Moved Machine spec to *Ratified* status.
    - Improvements to the description and commentary.
    - Specified which interrupt sources are reserved for standard use.
    - Allocated some synchronous exception causes for custom use.
    - Specified the priority ordering of synchronous exceptions.
    - Added specification that xRET instructions may, but are not required
      to, clear LR reservations if A extension present.
    - Made the `mstatus`.MPP field *WARL*, rather than *WLRL*.
    - Made the unused `__x__ip` fields *WPRI*, rather than *WIRI*.
    - Made the unused `misa` fields *WARL*, rather than *WIRI*.
    - Rectified an editing error that misdescribed the mechanism by which
      `mstatus.__x__IE` is written upon an exception.
    - Described scheme for emulating misaligned AMOs.
    - Specified the behavior of the `misa` and `__x__epc` registers in systems
      with variable IALIGN.
    - Specified the behavior of writing self-contradictory values to the
      `misa` register.

    - Moved PLIC chapter into its own document.
  - version: "1.12.0"
    state: ratified
    ratification_date: 2021-12
    changes:
    - Changed MRET to clear `mstatus`.MPRV when leaving M-mode.
    - Relaxed I/O regions have been specified to follow RVWMO. The previous
      specification implied that PPO rules other than fences and
      acquire/release annotations did not apply.
    - Constrained the LR/SC reservation set size and shape when using
      page-based virtual memory.
    - PMP changes require an SFENCE.VMA on any hart that implements
      page-based virtual memory, even if VM is not currently enabled.
    - Removed the N extension.
    - Defined the mandatory RV32-only CSR `mstatush`, which contains most of
      the same fields as the upper 32 bits of RV64’s `mstatus`.
    - Defined the mandatory CSR `mconfigptr`, which if nonzero contains the
      address of a configuration data structure.
    - Defined optional `mseccfg` and `mseccfgh` CSRs, which control the
      machine’s security configuration.
    - Defined `menvcfg` CSR (and RV32-only `menvcfgh`), which control various characteristics
      of the execution environment.
    - Designated part of SYSTEM major opcode for custom use.
    - Permitted the unconditional delegation of less-privileged interrupts.
    - Added optional big-endian and bi-endian support.
    - Made priority of load/store/AMO address-misaligned exceptions
      implementation-defined relative to load/store/AMO page-fault and
      access-fault exceptions.
    - Software breakpoint exceptions are permitted to write either 0 or the
      `pc` to `__x__tval`.
    - Specified relaxed constraints for implicit reads of non-idempotent regions.
  - version: "1.13.0"
    state: frozen
    ratification_date: 2023-12
    changes:
    - Redefined `misa`.MXL to be read-only, making MXLEN a constant.
    - Defined the `misa`.B field to reflect that the B extension has been
      implemented.
    - Defined the `misa`.V field to reflect that the V extension has been
      implemented.
    - Defined the RV32-only `medelegh` CSR.
    - Defined the misaligned atomicity granule PMA, superseding the proposed Zam
      extension.
    - Defined hardware error and software check exception codes.
    - Specified synchronization requirements when changing the PBMTE fields
      in `menvcfg` and `henvcfg`.
    - Exposed count-overflow interrupts to VS-mode via the Shlcofideleg extension.
    - Relaxed behavior of some HINTs when MXLEN > XLEN.
    - Transliterated the document from LaTeX into AsciiDoc.
    - Included all ratified extensions through March 2024.
    - Clarified that "platform- or custom-use" interrupts are actually
      "platform-use interrupts", where the platform can choose to make some custom.
    - Clarified semantics of explicit accesses to CSRs wider than XLEN bits.
    - Clarified that MXLEN&#8805;SXLEN.
    - Clarified that WFI is not a HINT instruction.
    - Clarified that, for a given exception cause, `__x__tval` might sometimes
      be set to a nonzero value but sometimes not.
    - Clarified exception behavior of unimplemented or inaccessible CSRs.
    - Replaced the concept of vacant memory regions with inaccessible memory or I/O regions.
    - Clarified that timer and count-overflow interrupts' arrival in
      interrupt-pending registers is not immediate.
    - Clarified that MXR affects only explicit memory accesses.

    This chapter describes the machine-level operations available in machine-mode (M-mode), which is
    the highest privilege mode in a RISC-V hart. M-mode is used for low-level access to a hardware
    platform and is the first mode entered at reset. M-mode can also be used to implement features that
    are too difficult or expensive to implement in hardware directly. The RISC-V machine-level ISA
    contains a common core that is extended depending on which other privilege levels are supported and
    other details of the hardware implementation.
    This chapter describes the RISC-V machine-level architecture, which
    contains a common core that is used with various supervisor-level
    address translation and protection schemes.
