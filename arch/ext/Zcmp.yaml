name: Zcmp
long_name: 16-bit Push/Pop instructions
description: |
  The Zcmp extension is a set of instructions which may be executed as a series of existing 32-bit RISC-V instructions.

  This extension reuses some encodings from _c.fsdsp_.  Therefore it is _incompatible_ with <<Zcd>>,
   which is included when C and D extensions are both present.

  NOTE: Zcmp is primarily targeted at embedded class CPUs due to implementation complexity. Additionally, it is not compatible with architecture class profiles.

  The Zcmp extension depends on the <<Zca>> extension.

  The PUSH/POP assembly syntax uses several variables, the meaning of which are:

  * _reg_list_ is a list containing 1 to 13 registers (ra and 0 to 12 s registers)
  ** valid values: {ra}, {ra, s0}, {ra, s0-s1}, {ra, s0-s2}, ..., {ra, s0-s8}, {ra, s0-s9}, {ra, s0-s11}
  ** note that {ra, s0-s10} is _not_ valid, giving 12 lists not 13 for better encoding
  * _stack_adj_ is the total size of the stack frame.
  ** valid values vary with register list length and the specific encoding, see the instruction pages for details.
