long_name: Pointer masking available in supervisor mode
description: |
  Indicates that there is pointer-masking support available in supervisor mode,
  with some facility provided in the application execution environment to control pointer masking.

  This extension describes an execution environment but has no bearing on hardware implementations.
  It is intended to be used in profile specifications where a Supervisor profile
  can only reference Supervisor level pointer masking functionality,
  and not the associated CSR controls that exist at a higher privilege level (i.e., in the execution environment).
