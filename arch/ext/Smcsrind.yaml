long_name: Machine Indirect CSR Access (Smcsrind)
description: |
  The `Smcsrind` extension defines indirect access to CSRs, allowing registers to be accessed through
  an index value (`miselect`) instead of using fixed CSR numbers. This mechanism reduces the need for
  large CSR address space allocation, making it more scalable and flexible. It enables the access of a set
  of registers that are not statically defined in the CSR space. Machine-level registers are accessed
  through `miselect` and `mireg*`, while supervisor-level registers are accessed through `siselect` and `sireg*`.
