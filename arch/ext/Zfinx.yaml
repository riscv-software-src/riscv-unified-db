description:
  - id: ext-zfinx-instructions
    normative: true
    text: |
      The Zfinx extension adds all of the instructions that the F extension adds, except for the
      transfer instructions FLW, FSW, FMV.W.X, FMV.X.W, C.FLW[SP], and C.FSW[SP].

  - id: ext-zfinx-semantics
    normative: true
    text: |
      The Zfinx variants of these F-extension instructions have the same semantics, except that
      whenever such an instruction would have accessed an f register, it instead accesses the
      x register with the same number.
