        Note that when IALIGN=16 (i.e., when the `C` or one of the `Zc*` extensions are implemented),
        it is impossible to generate a misaligned fetch, and so this parameter has no effect.

    NUM_PMP_ENTRIES:
      description: |
        Number of implemented PMP entries. Can be any value between 0-64, inclusive.
  
        The architecture mandates that the number of implemented PMP registers
        must appear to be 0, 16, or 64.

        Therefore, pmp registers will behave as follows according to NUN_PMP_ENTRIES:
        
        !===
        ! NUM_PMP_ENTRIES ! pmpaddr<0-15> / pmpcfg<0-3> ! pmpaddr<16-63> / pmpcfg<4-15>
        ! 0               ! N                           ! N
        ! 1-16            ! Y                           ! N
        ! 17-64           ! Y                           ! Y
        !===

        ** N = Not implemented; access will cause `IllegalInstruction`
           if TRAP_ON_UNIMPLEMENTED_CSR is true
        ** Y = Implemented; access will not cause an exception (from M-mode), but register
           may be read-only-zero if NUM_PMP_ENTRIES is less than the corresponding register
        
        [NOTE]
        `pmpcfgN` for an odd N never exists when XLEN == 64

        When NUM_PMP_ENTRIES is not exactly 0, 16, or 64, some extant pmp registers,
        and associated pmpNcfg, will be read-only zero (but will never cause an exception).
