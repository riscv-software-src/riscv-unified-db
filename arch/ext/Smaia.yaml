long_name: Advanced Interrupt Architecture, M-mode extension
description: |
  The Smaia extension defines all new machine-level CSRs and behavioral changes to the interrupt system as
  specified in the Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) v1.0. It includes support for interrupt delegation,
  virtual interrupt control, and prioritized interrupt delivery mechanisms.

  This extension is applicable to harts that support machine-level AIA features. It includes support for
  both local interrupt controller registers (like MVIP, MVIEN) and indirect CSR access mechanisms (via MISEL, MIREG).

  This extension takes precedence over conflicting behavior from other extensions unless explicitly overridden
  (e.g., by Smcsrind/Sscsrind).

  The existence and behavior of certain CSRs may depend on the implementation's privilege support (M, S, H) and XLEN.
