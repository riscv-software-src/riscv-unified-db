    This chapter describes the RISC-V supervisor-level architecture, which
    contains a common core that is used with various supervisor-level
    address translation and protection schemes.

    [NOTE]
    ====
    Supervisor mode is deliberately restricted in terms of interactions with
    underlying physical hardware, such as physical memory and device
    interrupts, to support clean virtualization. In this spirit, certain
    supervisor-level facilities, including requests for timer and
    interprocessor interrupts, are provided by implementation-specific
    mechanisms. In some systems, a supervisor execution environment (SEE)
    provides these facilities in a manner specified by a supervisor binary
    interface (SBI). Other systems supply these facilities directly, through
    some other implementation-defined mechanism.
