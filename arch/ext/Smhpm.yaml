  versions:
  - version: "1.11.0"
    state: ratified
    ratification_date: 2019-12
    changes:
    - Defined the `mcountinhibit` CSR, which stops performance counters from
      incrementing to reduce energy consumption.
  - version: "1.12.0"
    state: ratified
    ratification_date: 2021-12
    changes:
    - PMP changes require an SFENCE.VMA on any hart that implements
      page-based virtual memory, even if VM is not currently enabled.
    - PMP reset values are now platform-defined.
    - An additional 48 optional PMP registers have been defined.

    HPM_COUNTER_EN:
      description: |
        List of HPM counters that are enabled.
        There is one entry for each hpmcounter.

        The first three entries *must* be false (as they correspond to CY, IR, TM in, _e.g._ `mhmpcountinhibit`)
        Index 3 in HPM_COUNTER_EN corresponds to hpmcounter3.
        Index 31 in HPM_COUNTER_EN corresponds to hpmcounter31.

    COUNTINHIBIT_EN:
      description: |
        Indicates which hardware performance monitor counters can be disabled from `mcountinhibit`.

        An unimplemented counter cannot be specified, i.e., if HPM_COUNTER_EN[3] is false, 
        it would be illegal to set COUNTINHIBIT_EN[3] to true.

        COUNTINHIBIT_EN[1] can never be true, since it corresponds to `mcountinhibit.TM`,
        which is always read-only-0.

        COUNTINHIBIT_EN[3:31] must all be false if `Zihpm` is not implemented.

    MCOUNTENABLE_EN:
      description: |
        Indicates which counters can be delegated via `mcounteren`.

        An unimplemented counter cannot be specified, i.e., if
        HPM_COUNTER_EN[3] is false, it would be illegal to set
        MCOUNTENABLE_EN[3] to true.

        MCOUNTENABLE_EN[0:2] must all be false if `Zicntr` is not implemented.
        MCOUNTENABLE_EN[3:31] must all be false if `Zihpm` is not implemented.
