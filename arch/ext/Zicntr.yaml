    TIME_CSR_IMPLEMENTED:
      description: |
        Whether or not a real hardware `time` CSR exists. Implementations can either provide a real
        CSR or emulate access at M-mode.

        Possible values:

        true::
          `time`/`timeh` exists, and accessing it will not cause an IllegalInstruction trap
        
        false::
          `time`/`timeh` does not exist.
          Accessing the CSR will cause an IllegalInstruction trap or enter an unpredictable state,
          depending on TRAP_ON_UNIMPLEMENTED_CSR.
          Privileged software may emulate the `time` CSR, or may pass the exception to a lower level.
