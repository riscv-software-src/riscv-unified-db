Zfhmin:
  long_name: Minimal half-precision Floating-point
  description: |
    `Zfhmin` provides
    minimal support for 16-bit half-precision binary floating-point
    instructions. The Zfhmin extension is a subset of the `Zfh` extension,
    consisting only of data transfer and conversion instructions. Like `Zfh`,
    the `Zfhmin` extension depends on the single-precision floating-point
    extension, `F`. The expectation is that `Zfhmin` software primarily uses the
    half-precision format for storage, performing most computation in higher
    precision.

    The `Zfhmin` extension includes the following instructions from the `Zfh`
    extension: `flh`, `fsh`, `fmv.x.h`, `fmv.h.x`, `fcvt.s.h`, and `fcvt.h.s`.
    If the `D` extension is present, the `fcvt.d.h` and `fcvt.h.d` instructions are also
    included. If the `Q` extension is present, the `fcvt.q.h` and `fcvt.h.q`
    instructions are additionally included.

    [NOTE]
    ====
    `Zfhmin` does not include the `fsgnj.h` instruction, because it suffices to
    instead use the `fsgnj.s` instruction to move half-precision values
    between floating-point registers.

    Half-precision addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
    square-root operations can be faithfully emulated by converting the
    half-precision operands to single-precision, performing the operation
    using single-precision arithmetic, then converting back to
    half-precision. cite:[roux:hal-01091186] Performing half-precision fused multiply-addition using
    this method incurs a 1-ulp error on some inputs for the RNE and RMM
    rounding modes.

    Conversion from 8- or 16-bit integers to half-precision can be emulated
    by first converting to single-precision, then converting to
    half-precision. Conversion from 32-bit integer can be emulated by first
    converting to double-precision. If the `D` extension is not present and a
    1-ulp error under RNE or RMM is tolerable, 32-bit integers can be first
    converted to single-precision instead. The same remark applies to
    conversions from 64-bit integers without the `Q` extension.
