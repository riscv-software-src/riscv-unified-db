Zba:
  description: |
    The Zba instructions can be used to accelerate the generation of addresses that index into
    arrays of basic types (halfword, word, doubleword) using both unsigned word-sized and
    XLEN-sized indices: a shifted index is added to a base address.

    The shift and add instructions do a left shift of 1, 2, or 3 because these are commonly found
    in real-world code and because they can be implemented with a minimal amount of additional
    hardware beyond that of the simple adder. This avoids lengthening the critical path in
    implementations.

    While the shift and add instructions are limited to a maximum left shift of 3, the `slli`
    instruction (from the base ISA) can be used to perform similar shifts for indexing into arrays
    of wider elements. The `slli.uw` -- added in this extension -- can be used when the index is to
    be interpreted as an unsigned word.
