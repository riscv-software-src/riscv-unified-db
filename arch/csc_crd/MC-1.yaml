MC-1:
  name: MC-1
  long_name: LONG NAME
  family: Microcontroller
  
  # semantic version within the CRD family
  version: "1.0"

  description: |
    MC-1 can be though of as a minimal 32-bit RISC-V processor with M-mode support:

    * The Unprivileged ISA is RV32I with a few extensions suitable for a basic microcontroller
    * The M-mode features are those listed as mandatory in the RISC-V Privileged ISA manual.

    Key features not included in MC-1 (i.e., OUT OF SCOPE):

    * Interrupt Controller (e.g., CLIC, CLINT, PLIC)
    * Features for modes other than M-mode
    * PMP
    * Debug & trace (TBD)

  requirement_groups:
    - name: MC-Unpriv
      description: |
        The MC-Unpriv defines unprivileged ISA requirements.
        Note that unprivileged ISA features are those that are usable in all privilege modes;
        they aren't only usable in U-mode (User-mode).
        It is unfortunate that both “Unprivileged” and “User” start with the letter “U” but they
        aren't the same thing.
