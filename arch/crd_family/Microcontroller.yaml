  name: Microcontroller
  long_name: LONG NAME
  revision_history:
  - version: "0.7"
    date: 2024-07-29
    changes:
    - First version after moving non-microcontroller content in this document to a new document
      called “RISC-V CRDs (Certification Requirement Documents)”
    - Change MC-1 Unpriv ISA spec from
      “https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/riscv-spec-v2.1.pdf[riscv-spec-v2.1], May 31,
      2016” to https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/tag/Ratified-IMAFDQC since the
      former isn't ratified by the latter is the oldest ratified version.
    - Added requirements for WFI instruction
    - Added requirements related to msip memory-mapped register
  - version: "0.6"
    date: 2024-07-11
    changes:
    - Supporting multiple MC versions to support customers wanting to certify existing microcontrollers not using the latest version of ratified standards.
    - Changed versioning scheme to use major.minor.patch instead of 3-digit major & minor.
    - Added a table showing the mapping from MC version to ISA manuals.
    - Reluctantly made interrupts OUT OF SCOPE for MC-1 since only the CLINT interrupt controller
      was ratified at that time and isn’t anticipated to be the interrupt controller used by MC-1 implementations.
    - Clarified MANDATORY behaviors for mie and mip CSRs
    - Removed canonical discovery recipe because the OPT-* options directly inform the certification
      tests and certification reference model of the status of the various options. Also, canonical
      discovery recipes (e.g., probing for CLIC) violate the certification approach of avoiding writing
      potentially illegal values to CSR fields.
    - Added more options for interrupts
    - Moved non-microcontroller content in this document to a new document called “RISC-V Certification Plans”
  - version: "0.5"
    date: 2024-06-03
    changes:
    - Renamed to “RISC-V Microcontroller Certification Plan” based on Jason’s recommendation
    - Added mvendorid, marchid, mimpid, and mhardid read-only priv CSRs because Allen pointed out
      these are mandatory in M-mode v1.13 (probably older versions too, haven’t looked yet).
    - Added table showing mapping of MC versions to associated RISC-V specifications
  - version: "0.4"
    date: 2024-06-03
    changes:
    - Added M-mode instruction requirements
    - Made Zicntr MANDATORY due to very low cost for implementations to support (in the spirit of minimizing options).
    - Removed OPT-CNTR-PREC since minstret and mcycle must be a full 64 bits to be standard-compliant.
  - version: "0.3"
    date: 2024-05-25
    changes:
    - Includes Zicntr as OPTIONAL and then has only 32-bit counters for instret and cycle.
  - version: "0.2"
    date: 2024-05-20
    changes:
    - Very early draft
  - version: "0.1"
    date: 2024-05-16
    changes:
    - Initial version

  introduction: |
    This CRD (Certification Requirements Document) specifies requirements for microcontrollers.
    It targets microcontrollers running low-level software on an RTOS or bare-metal.
    This CRD is not intended for the smallest possible microcontrollers but rather for applications
    benefiting from a standardized microcontroller.
    See the https://docs.google.com/document/d/133SZKc18tLsQcT1o6gEmBUkjwrtg2ow63me54RQ1jiY[RISC-V CRDs]
    document for information relevant to all RISC-V CRDs.

  naming_scheme: |
    The MC (M = Microcontroller, C = Certificate) has the following naming scheme (suffixes after MC
    are optional but in the below order):

     MC<-VERSION><-MODE><-XLEN>

    Where:

    * \<-VERSION> is formatted as -<major>[.<minor>.[patch]] where left & right square braces denote optional. If \<-VERSION> is omitted, the reference applies equally to all versions. 
    ** A <major> release indicates significant new functionality covered by the release.
    ** A <minor> release is an update to the initial major release that changes requirements. The initial major release has an implicit minor release value of “.0” so the first update to a major release has a minor release of “.1”.
    ** A <patch> release only provides specification clarifications and doesn’t change requirements. The initial minor release has an implicit patch release value of “.0” so the first update to a minor release has a patch release of “.1”.
    ** For example, the first release of MC is MC-1 (can omit the implicit “.0” minor release), its first minor release is MC-1.1, a patch release of this minor release is MC-1.1.1 and the next major release is MC-2.
    * \<-MODE> is -Unpriv, -Priv, or -Debug. If \<-MODE> is omitted, the reference applies equally to all modes.
    * \<-XLEN> is -32 for 32-bit microcontrollers and -64 for 64-bit microcontrollers. If \<-XLEN> is omitted, the reference applies equally to 32-bit and 64-bit microcontrollers. The term MXLEN used in the Priv ISA Manual is always equal to XLEN for MC.
