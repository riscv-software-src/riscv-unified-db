introduction: The RVI profile class documents the initial set of unprivileged instructions.
description: |
  The RVI profile class provides a generic target for software toolchains
  and represent the minimum level of compatibility with RISC-V ratified standards.

  NOTE: Profiles in this class are designated as _unprivileged_ profiles as opposed to
  _user_-_mode_ profiles.  Code using this profile class can run in any
  privilege mode, and so requested and fatal traps may be horizontal
  traps into an execution environment running in the same privilege mode.
naming_scheme: |
  The profile class name is RVI (RISC-V base Integer instructions).
  A profile release name is an integer (currently 2 digits, could grow in the future).
  A full profile name is comprised of, in order:

  * Prefix *RVI* for RISC-V Integer
  * Profile release
  * Privilege mode:
  ** *U* Unprivileged (available to any privilege mode, *U* is *not* User-mode)
  * A base ISA XLEN specifier (*32*, *64*)
