long_name: Apps Processor profile class for Bespoke Rich Operating System
marketing_name: RVB
introduction: |
  The RVB profile class targets application processors for markets
  running Bespoke (AKA custom, AKA Yocto) Linux Operating Systems
  in embedded applications.
description: |
  The RVB profile class is intended to be used for 64-bit application
  processors running rich OS stacks.  Only user-mode and
  supervisor-mode profiles are specified in this class.

  NOTE: There is no machine-mode profile currently defined for RVB.
  A machine-mode profile for application processors would only be used in specifying platforms for
  portable machine-mode software. Given the relatively low volume of
  portable M-mode software in this domain, the wide variety of potential
  M-mode code, and the very specific needs of each type of M-mode
  software, we are not specifying individual M-mode ISA requirements in
  the RVB profiles.

  NOTE: Only XLEN=64 application processor profiles are currently
  defined.  It would be possible to also define very similar XLEN=32
  variants.
naming_scheme: |
  The profile class name is RVB (RISC-V Bespoke processor).
  A profile release name is a integer (currently 2 digits, could grow in the future).
  A full profile name is comprised of, in order:

  * Prefix *RVB* for RISC-V Bespoke
  * Profile release
  * Privilege mode:
  ** *U* Unprivileged (available to any privilege mode, *U* is *not* User-mode)
  ** *S* Supervisor mode (note that Hypervisor support is treated as an option)
  ** *M* Machine mode
  * A base ISA XLEN specifier (*32*, *64*)

  The initial profiles based on specifications ratified in 2024 are:

  * RVB23U64, RVB23S64 64-bit application-processor profiles

  NOTE: Profile names are embeddable into RISC-V ISA naming strings.
  This implies that there will be no standard ISA extension with a name
  that matches the profile naming convention.  This allows tools that
  process the RISC-V ISA naming string to parse and/or process a combined string.
