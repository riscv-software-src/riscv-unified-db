long_name: Move single-precision value from floating-point to integer register
description: |
  Moves the single-precision value in floating-point register rs1 represented in IEEE 754-2008
  encoding to the lower 32 bits of integer register rd.
  The bits are not modified in the transfer, and in particular, the payloads of non-canonical
  NaNs are preserved.
  For RV64, the higher 32 bits of the destination register are filled with copies of the
  floating-point number's sign bit.
