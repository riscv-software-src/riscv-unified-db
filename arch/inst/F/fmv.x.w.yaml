  long_name: Move single-precision value from floating-point to integer register
  description: |
      Moves the single-precision value in floating-point register rs1 represented in IEEE 754-2008
      encoding to the lower 32 bits of integer register rd.
      The bits are not modified in the transfer, and in particular, the payloads of non-canonical
      NaNs are preserved.
      For RV64, the higher 32 bits of the destination register are filled with copies of the
      floating-point number's sign bit.
