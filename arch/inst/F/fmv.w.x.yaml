  long_name: Single-precision floating-point move from integer
  description: |
    Moves the single-precision value encoded in IEEE 754-2008 standard encoding
    from the lower 32 bits of integer register `rs1` to the floating-point
    register `rd`. The bits are not modified in the transfer, and in particular,
    the payloads of non-canonical NaNs are preserved.
