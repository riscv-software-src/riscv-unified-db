    The instruction applies the inverse MixColumns transformation to two columns of the state array,
    packed into a single 64-bit register. It is used to create the inverse cipher KeySchedule, according to
    the equivalent inverse cipher construction in (NIST, 2001) (Page 23, Section 5.3.5). This
    instruction must always be implemented such that its execution latency does not depend on the
    data being operated on.
