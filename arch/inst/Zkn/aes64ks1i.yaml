    This instruction implements the rotation, SubBytes and Round Constant addition steps of the AES
    block cipher Key Schedule. This instruction must _always_ be implemented such that its execution
    latency does not depend on the data being operated on. Note that `rnum` must be in the range
    `0x0..0xA`. The values `0xB..0xF` are reserved.
