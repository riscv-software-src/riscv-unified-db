  long_name: Move half-precision value from floating-point to integer register
  definedBy:
    anyOf: [Zfh, Zfhmin]
  assembly: rd, fs1
  description: |
     Moves the half-precision value in floating-point register rs1 represented in IEEE 754-2008
     encoding to the lower 16 bits of integer register rd.

     The bits are not modified in the transfer, and in particular, the payloads of non-canonical
     NaNs are preserved.

     The highest XLEN-16 bits of the destination register are filled with copies of the
     floating-point number's sign bit.
  encoding:
    match: 111001000000-----000-----1010011
    variables:
    - name: fs1
      location: 19-15
    - name: rd
      location: 11-7

    X[rd] = sext(f[fs1][15:0], 16);
