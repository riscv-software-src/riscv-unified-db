long_name: Load doubleword from stack pointer
description: |
  C.LDSP is an RV64C/RV128C-only instruction that loads a 64-bit value from memory
  into register rd.
  It computes its effective address by adding the zero-extended offset, scaled by 8,
  to the stack pointer, x2.
  It expands to `ld` `rd, offset(x2)`.
  C.LDSP is only valid when rd &ne; x0 the code points with rd=x0 are reserved.
