ecall:
  long_name: Environment call
  description: |
    The ECALL instruction is used to make a request to the supporting execution environment.
    When executed in U-mode, S-mode, or M-mode, it generates an environment-call-from-U-mode
    exception, environment-call-from-S-mode exception, or environment-call-from-M-mode
    exception, respectively, and performs no other operation.

    [NOTE]
    ECALL generates a different exception for each originating privilege mode so that
    environment call exceptions can be selectively delegated.
    A typical use case for Unix-like operating systems is to delegate to S-mode
    the environment-call-from-U-mode exception but not the others.

    ECALL causes the receiving privilege mode's epc register to be set to the address of
    the ECALL instruction itself, not the address of the following instruction.
    As ECALL causes a synchronous exception, it is not considered to retire,
    and should not increment the `minstret` CSR.
