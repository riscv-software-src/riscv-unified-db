description: |
  The Zimop extension defines 8 MOP instructions named MOP.RR.n, where n is an integer between 0
  and 7, inclusive. Unless redefined by another extension, these instructions simply write 0 to X[rd].
  Their encoding allows future extensions to define them to read X[rs1] and X[rs2], as well as write X[rd].
