  long_name: Atomic Read/Write CSR Immediate
  description: |
    Atomically write CSR using a 5-bit immediate, and load the previous value into 'rd'.

    Read the old value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to `XLEN` bits,
    and then write it to integer register rd.
    The 5-bit uimm field is zero-extended and written to the CSR.
    If `rd=x0`, then the instruction shall not read the CSR and shall not
    cause any of the side effects that might occur on a CSR read.
