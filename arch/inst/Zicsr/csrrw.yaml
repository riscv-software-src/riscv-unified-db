  long_name: Atomic Read/Write CSR
  description: |
    Atomically swap values in the CSRs and integer registers.

    Read the old value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to `XLEN` bits,
    and then write it to integer register rd.
    The initial value in rs1 is written to the CSR.
    If `rd=x0`, then the instruction shall not read the CSR and shall not
    cause any of the side effects that might occur on a CSR read.
