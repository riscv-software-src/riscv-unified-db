  long_name: Atomic Read and Set Bits in CSR
  description: |
    Atomically read and set bits in a CSR.

    Reads the value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to `XLEN` bits,
    and writes it to integer register `rd`. The initial value in integer
    register `rs1` is treated as a bit mask that specifies bit positions
    to be set in the CSR. Any bit that is high in `rs1` will cause the
    corresponding bit to be set in the CSR, if that CSR bit is writable.
    Other bits in the CSR are not explicitly written.
