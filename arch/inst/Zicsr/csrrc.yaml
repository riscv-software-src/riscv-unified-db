    The CSRRC (Atomic Read and Clear Bits in CSR) instruction reads the value of the CSR, zero-extends
    the value to XLEN bits, and writes it to integer register `rd`. The initial value in integer register `rs1` is
    treated as a bit mask that specifies bit positions to be cleared in the CSR. Any bit that is high in `rs1` will
    cause the corresponding bit to be cleared in the CSR, if that CSR bit is writable.

    For CSRRC, if `rs1=x0`, then the instruction will not write to the CSR at all, and so shall
    not cause any of the side effects that might otherwise occur on a CSR write, nor raise illegal-
    instruction exceptions on accesses to read-only CSRs. CSRRC always reads the addressed CSR and
    cause any read side effects regardless of `rs1` and `rd` fields.
    Note that if `rs1` specifies a register other than `x0`, and that register holds a zero value,
    the instruction will not action any attendant per-field side effects, but will action any
    side effects caused by writing to the entire CSR.
