  Atomically loads a 32-bit value from memory, compares it with a 32-bit
  register value, and swaps if equal.

  **RV32 & RV64 Operation:**
  - Atomically loads a 32-bit value from the memory address in rs1.
  - Compares the loaded value with the lower 32 bits of rd.
  - If the comparison is bitwise equal, stores the lower 32 bits of rs2
    back to rs1.
  - Updates rd with the loaded value.
  - In RV64, rd is sign-extended to 64 bits.
