  long_name: Signed division
  description: |
    Divide rs1 by rs2, and store the result in rd. The remainder is discarded.

    Division by zero will put -1 into rd.
    
    Division resulting in signed overflow (when most negative number is divided by -1)
    will put the most negative number into rd;
