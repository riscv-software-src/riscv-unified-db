mul:
  long_name: Signed multiply
  description: |
    MUL performs an XLEN-bitxXLEN-bit multiplication of `rs1` by `rs2` and places the lower
    XLEN bits in the destination register.
    Any overflow is thrown away.

    [NOTE]
    If both the high and low bits of the same product are required, then the recommended code
    sequence is:
    MULH[[S]U] rdh, rs1, rs2; MUL rdl, rs1, rs2
    (source register specifiers must be in same order and rdh cannot be the same as rs1 or rs2).
    Microarchitectures can then fuse these into a single multiply operation instead of
    performing two separate multiplies.
