  long_name: Signed 32-bit division
  description: |
    Divide the lower 32-bits of register rs1 by the lower 32-bits of register rs2,
    and store the sign-extended result in rd.
    
    The remainder is discarded.

    Division by zero will put -1 into rd.
    
    Division resulting in signed overflow (when most negative number is divided by -1)
    will put the most negative number into rd;
