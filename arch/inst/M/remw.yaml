  long_name: Signed 32-bit remainder
  description: |
    Calculate the remainder of signed division of the 32-bit values rs1 by rs2,
    and store the sign-extended result in rd.

    If the value in register rs2 is zero, write the sign-extended 32-bit value in rs1 into rd;

    If the result of the division overflows, write zero into rd;
