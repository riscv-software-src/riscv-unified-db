mulw:
  long_name: Signed 32-bit multiply
  description: |
    Multiplies the lower 32 bits of the source registers, placing the sign-extension of the
    lower 32 bits of the result into the destination register.

    Any overflow is thrown away.

    [NOTE]
    In RV64, MUL can be used to obtain the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit product,
    but signed arguments must be proper 32-bit signed values, whereas unsigned arguments
    must have their upper 32 bits clear. If the arguments are not known to be sign- or zero-extended,
    an alternative is to shift both arguments left by 32 bits, then use MULH[[S]U].
