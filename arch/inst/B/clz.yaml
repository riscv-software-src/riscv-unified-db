  long_name: Count leading zero bits
  description: |
    This instruction counts the number of 0's before the first 1,
    starting at the most-significant bit (i.e., XLEN-1) and progressing to bit 0.
    Accordingly, if the input is 0, the output is XLEN, and if the most-significant
    bit of the input is a 1, the output is 0.
