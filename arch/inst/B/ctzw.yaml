  long_name: Count trailing zero bits in word
  description: |
    This instruction counts the number of 0's before the first 1,
    starting at the least-significant bit (i.e., 0) and progressing
    to the most-significant bit of the least-significant word (i.e., 31). Accordingly, if the
    least-significant word is 0, the output is 32, and if the least-significant bit
    of the input is a 1, the output is 0.
