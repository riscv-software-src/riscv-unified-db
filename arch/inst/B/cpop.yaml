cpop:
  long_name: Count set bits
  description: |
    This instructions counts the number of 1's (i.e., set bits) in the source register.

    .Software Hint
    [NOTE]
    ----
    This operations is known as population count, popcount, sideways sum,
    bit summation, or Hamming weight.

    The GCC builtin function `__builtin_popcount (unsigned int x)` is
    implemented by cpop on RV32 and by cpopw on RV64. The GCC builtin
    function `__builtin_popcountl (unsigned long x)` for LP64 is
    implemented by cpop on RV64.
