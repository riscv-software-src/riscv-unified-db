zext.h:
  long_name: Zero-extend halfword
  description: |
    This instruction zero-extends the least-significant halfword of the source to XLEN by inserting
    0's into all of the bits more significant than 15.

    [NOTE]
    The *zext.h* instruction is a pseudo-op for `pack` when `Zbkb` is implemented and XLEN == 32.

    [NOTE]
    The *zext.h* instruction is a pseduo-op for `packw` when `Zbkb` is implmeneted and XLEN == 64.
