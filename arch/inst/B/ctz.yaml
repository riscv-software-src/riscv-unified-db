  long_name: Count trailing zero bits
  description: |
    This instruction counts the number of 0's before the first 1,
    starting at the least-significant bit (i.e., 0) and progressing
    to the most-significant bit (i.e., XLEN-1). Accordingly, if the
    input is 0, the output is XLEN, and if the least-significant bit
    of the input is a 1, the output is 0.
