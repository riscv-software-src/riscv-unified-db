  long_name: Count leading zero bits in word
  description: |
    This instruction counts the number of 0's before the first 1 starting at bit 31 and progressing to bit 0.
    Accordingly, if the least-significant word is 0, the output is 32, and if the most-significant
    bit of the word (_i.e._, bit 31) is a 1, the output is 0.
