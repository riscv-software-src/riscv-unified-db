    text: |
      `fcvtmod.w.d` always rounds towards zero. Bits 31:0 are taken from the rounded, unbounded two's
      complement result, then sign-extended to XLEN bits and written to integer register `xd`.±∞ and
      NaN are converted to zero.

      Floating-point exception flags are raised the same as they would be for FCVT.W.D with the same input
      operand.

      This instruction is only provided if the D extension is implemented. It is encoded like FCVT.W.D, but
      with the `xs2` field set to 8 and the `rm` field set to 1 (RTZ). Other `rm` values are reserved.
