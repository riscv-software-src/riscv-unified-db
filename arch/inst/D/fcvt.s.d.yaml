      `fcvt.s.d` converts a double-precision floating-point number to a single-precision floating-point number.
       This is encoded in the OP-FP major opcode space and both the source and destination are floating-point
       registers. The `rs2` field encodes the datatype of the source, and the `fmt` field encodes the datatype
       of the destination. `fcvt.s.d` rounds according to the RM field
