name: aes32dsmi
long_name: AES middle round decryption instruction for RV32
description: |
  This instruction sources a single byte from `rs2` according to `bs`. To this it applies the inverse AES
  SBox operation, and a partial inverse MixColumn, before XOR'ing the result with `rs1`. This
  instruction must always be implemented such that its execution latency does not depend on the
  data being operated on.
