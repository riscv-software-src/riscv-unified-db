lr.w:
  long_name: Load reserved word
  description: |
     Loads a word from the address in rs1, places the sign-extended value in rd,
     and registers a _reservation set_  -- a set of bytes that subsumes the bytes in the
     addressed word.

     <%- if XLEN == 64 -%>
     The 32-bit load result is sign-extended to 64-bits.
     <%- end -%>

     The address in rs1 must be naturally aligned to the size of the operand
     (_i.e._, eight-byte aligned for doublewords and four-byte aligned for words).

     If the address is not naturally aligned, a `LoadAddressMisaligned` exception or an
     `LoadAccessFault` exception will be generated. The access-fault exception can be generated
     for a memory access that would otherwise be able to complete except for the misalignment,
     if the misaligned access should not be emulated.

     An implementation can register an arbitrarily large reservation set on each LR, provided the
     reservation set includes all bytes of the addressed data word or doubleword.
     An SC can only pair with the most recent LR in program order.
     An SC may succeed only if no store from another hart to the reservation set can be
     observed to have occurred between the LR and the SC, and if there is no other SC between the
     LR and itself in program order.
     An SC may succeed only if no write from a device other than a hart to the bytes accessed by
     the LR instruction can be observed to have occurred between the LR and SC. Note this LR
     might have had a different effective address and data size, but reserved the SC's
     address as part of the reservation set.

     [NOTE]
     ----
     Following this model, in systems with memory translation, an SC is allowed to succeed if the
     earlier LR reserved the same location using an alias with a different virtual address, but is
     also allowed to fail if the virtual address is different.

     To accommodate legacy devices and buses, writes from devices other than RISC-V harts are only
     required to invalidate reservations when they overlap the bytes accessed by the LR.
     These writes are not required to invalidate the reservation when they access other bytes in
     the reservation set.
     ----

     Software should not set the _rl_ bit on an LR instruction unless the _aq_ bit is also set.
     LR.rl and SC.aq instructions are not guaranteed to provide any stronger ordering than those
     with both bits clear, but may result in lower performance.
