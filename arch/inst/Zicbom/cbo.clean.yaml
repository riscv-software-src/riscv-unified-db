name: cbo.clean
long_name: Cache Block Clean
description: |
  Cleans an entire cache block globally throughout the system.

  Exactly what happens is coherence protocol-dependent, but in general it is expected that after this
  operation():

    * The cache block will be in the clean (not dirty) state in any coherent cache holding a valid copy of the line.
    * The data will be cleaned to a point such that an incoherent load can observe the cleaned data.

  `cbo.clean` is ordered by `FENCE` instructions but not `FENCE.I` or `SFENCE.VMA`.

  <%- if CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE.bit_length > [PMP_GRANULARITY, PMA_GRANULARITY].min -%>
  Both PMP and PMA access control must be the same for all bytes in the block; otherwise, `cbo.clean` has UNSPECIFIED behavior.
  <%- end -%>

  Clean operations are treated as stores for page and access permissions. If permission checks fail,
  one of the following exceptions will occur:

    <%- if ext?(:H) -%>
    * `Store/AMO Guest-Page Fault` if virtual memory translation fails during G-stage translation.
    <%- end -%>
    * `Store/AMO Page Fault` if virtual memory translation fails <% if ext?(:H) %>when V=0 or during VS-stage translation<% end %>
    * `Store/AMO Access Fault` if a PMP or PMA access check fails

  <%- if CACHE_BLOCK_SIZE.bit_length <= [PMP_GRANULARITY, PMA_GRANULARITY].min -%>
  Because cache blocks are naturally aligned and always fit in a single PMP or PMA regions, the PMP
  and PMA access checks only need to check a single address in the line.
  <%- end -%>

  CBO operations never raise a misaligned address fault.

  Access is controlled through `menvcfg.CBZE`, `senvcfg.CBZE`, and `henvcfg.CBZE`.
  When access is denied, the instruction either raises an `Illegal Instruction`
  or `Virtual Instruction` exception according to the table below.
