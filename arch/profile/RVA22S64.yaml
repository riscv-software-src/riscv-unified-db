    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |

  Sstc:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      Sstc was not made mandatory in RVA22S64 as it is a more
      disruptive change affecting system-level architecture, and will take
      longer for implementations to adopt.  It is expected to be made
      mandatory in the next profile release.
  Sscofpmf:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      Platforms may choose to mandate the presence of Sscofpmf.
  Zkr:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      Technically, Zk is also a privileged-mode option capturing that
      Zkr, Zkn, and Zkt are all implemented.  However, the Zk rollup is less
      descriptive than specifying the individual extensions explicitly.
  H:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      The following extensions become mandatory when H is implemented:

        * Ssstateen
        * Shcounterenw
        * Shvstvala
        * Shtvala
        * Shvstvecd
