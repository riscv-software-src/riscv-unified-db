introduction: |
  The RVA22S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
  supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
  processors.  RVA22S64 is based on privileged architecture version
  1.12.
extensions:
  $inherits:
    - "profile/RVA20S64.yaml#/extensions"
    - "profile/RVA22U64.yaml#/extensions"
  S:
    presence: mandatory
    version: "= 1.12"
  Sscounterenw:
    presence: mandatory
    version: "= 1.0"
    note: |
      Sstvala is a new extension name introduced with RVA22.
  Svpbmt:
    presence: mandatory
    version: "~> 1.0"
  Svinval:
    presence: mandatory
    version: "~> 1.0"
  Sv48:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.12"
  Sv57:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.12"
  Svnapot:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      It is expected that Svnapot will be mandatory in the next
      profile release.
  Sstc:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      Sstc was not made mandatory in RVA22S64 as it is a more
      disruptive change affecting system-level architecture, and will take
      longer for implementations to adopt.  It is expected to be made
      mandatory in the next profile release.
  Sscofpmf:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      Platforms may choose to mandate the presence of Sscofpmf.
  Zkr:
    presence: optional
    version: "~> 1.0"
    note: |
      Technically, Zk is also a privileged-mode option capturing that
      Zkr, Zkn, and Zkt are all implemented.  However, the Zk rollup is less
      descriptive than specifying the individual extensions explicitly.
  Sha:
    presence: optional
    version: "~>1.0"
    note: |
      The set of augmented hypervisor extensions: H, Ssstateen,
      Shcounterenw, Shvstvala, Shtvala, Shvstvecd, Shvsatpa, Shgatpa.
      The Sha extension name was introduced in RVA23/RVB23 and wasn't
      in the ratified RVA22 profile but has since been added retroactively
      as a documentation-only change (doesn't affect requirements or functionality).
