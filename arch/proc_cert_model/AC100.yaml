introduction: |
  The AC100 Processor Certificate targets RISC-V Apps Processors running rich operating systems such as
  custom Yocto Linux.
  Software source code compatibility is a strong requirement and binary compatibility is a lesser requirement.

  AC100 is based on the following:

  * RVB23 Profile without Hypervisor or Vector support
  * M-mode requirements
  * AIA or PLIC interrupt controller
  * Debug and trace (TBD)

    name: M-mode Requirements
    description: |
      Extra requirements for M-mode beyond the minimum M-mode defined by the Sm extension.
      These extra requirements come from https://github.com/riscv/riscv-profiles/blob/main/src/old-m-profiles.adoc.
    requirements:
      - name: REQ-M_Mode-Non_Zero_CSRs
        description: The `mvendorid`, `marchid`, and `mimpid` CSRs must be nonzero.
      - name: REQ-M_Mode-mstatus_writable_fields
        description: The `mstatus.TVM`, `mstatus.TW`, and `mstatus.TSR` CSR fields must be writable.
      - name: REQ-M_Mode-medeleg_writable_bits
        description: The `medeleg` CSR bits 3, 8, 12, 13, and 15 must be writable.
      - name: REQ-M_Mode-mideleg_writable_bits
        description: The `mideleg` CSR bits 1, 5, and 9 must be writable.
      - name: REQ-M_Mode-mideleg_readonlyzero_bits
        description: The `mideleg` CSR bits 3, 7, and 11 must be read-only zero.
      - name: REQ-M_Mode-mcounteren_writable_bits
        description: For any `mhpmcounter` that is writable, the corresponding bit in `mcounteren` must be writable.
