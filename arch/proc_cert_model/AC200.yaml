introduction: |
  The AC200 Processor Certificate targets RISC-V Apps Processors running rich operating systems such as
  commercial Linux distributions or Android.
  Software source code compatibility and binary compatibility between implementations are strong requirements.

  AC200 is based on the following:

  * RVA23 Profile (includes mandatory Hypervisor and Vector support)
  * M-mode requirements
  * AIA or PLIC interrupt controller
  * Debug and trace (TBD)
