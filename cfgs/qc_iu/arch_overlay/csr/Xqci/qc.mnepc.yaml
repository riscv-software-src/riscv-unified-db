      When a non-maskable interrupt is taken into M-mode, `qc.mnepc.PC` is written with the PC
      of the next instruction (_i.e._, the one that would be fetched next if the interrupt did not
      occur). Otherwise, `qc.mnepc.PC` is never written by the implementation, though it may be
      explicitly written by software.
