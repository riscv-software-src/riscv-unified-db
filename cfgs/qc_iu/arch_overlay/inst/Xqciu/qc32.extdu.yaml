  long_name: Extract bits from pair unsigned (Immediate)
  description: |
    Extract a subset of bits from the register pair [`rs1`, `rs1`+1] into `rd`.
    The width of the subset is determined by (`width_minus1` + 1) (1..32),
    and the offset (into the pair) of the subset is determined by `shamt`.
