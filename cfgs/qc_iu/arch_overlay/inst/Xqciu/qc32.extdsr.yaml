  long_name: Extract bits from pair signed (Register)
  description: |
    Extract a subset of bits from the register pair [`rs1`, `rs1`+1] into `rd`, and sign extend the result.
    The width of the subset is determined by `rs2` bits [31:16] + 1 (1..32),
    and the offset of the subset is determined by `rs2` bits [15:0].
