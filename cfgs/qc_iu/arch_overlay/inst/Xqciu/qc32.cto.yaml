  long_name: Count trailing ones
  description: |
    Count the number of ones before the first zero in `rs1`, starting from the LSB
    and progressing to the MSB.
    Accordingly, if the input is ~0, the output is XLEN, and if the least-significant
    bit of the input is a 0, the output is 0.
    Output written to `rd`
