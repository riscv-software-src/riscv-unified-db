  long_name: Insert bits in 64-bit higher part (Register)
  description: |
    Insertion of a subset of bits from `rs1` into `rd`.
    Instruction intended for insertion bits into bitfield within 64-bits,
    when bitfield crosses 32-bit bundary. 
    Lower part of 64-bit destination is inserted using QC32.INSB, 
    higher part using QC32.INSBH.
    The width of the subset is determined by `rs2` bits [31:16] + 1 (1..32),
    and the offset of the subset is determined by `rs2` bits [15:0].
    In case when width + offset <= 32, the destination register is left unchanged.
