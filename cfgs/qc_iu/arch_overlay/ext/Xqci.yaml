description: |
  The Xqci extension includes a set of instructions that improve RISC-V code density and
  performance in microontrollers. It fills several gaps:

  Long immediates::
  --
  This extension provides wide-immediate versions of
  loads, stores, branches, jumps, and several arithmetic operations.
  --

  Addressing modes::
  --
  New indexed addressing modes are added for load and store instructions.
  --

  Load/store multiple::
  --
  Xqci adds instructions that load multiple sequential values from memory into multiple registers.
  Analogous instructions for stores are also included.
  --

  Branch immediate instructions::
  --
  The base RISC-V ISA provides conditional branches that compare two register values.
  Xqci adds conditional branch instructions that compare an immediate value to a register value,
  reducing a common code sequence into a single instruction.
  --

  Conditional instructions::
  --
  Xqci includes a variety of conditional select instructions that pick one of two operand values based on the result of a condition
  and conditional move instructions that either move a value or retain a value in a destination register based on the result of a condition.
  Conditional select and conditional move instructions help reduce code size and avoid branches in common code sequences.
  --

  Extra bit manipulation instructions::
  --
  Xqci expands upon the standard `B` extension by adding instructions for
  bit insertion/extraction, bit set/clear, sign and zero extension, and bit counting instructions.
  --

  Fast interrupt instructions::
  --
  Xqci adds instructions to accelerate interrupt handling, including instructions to quickly
  enable/disable interrupts and instructions to automatically save an interrupt frame.
  --

  Saturating arithmetic::
  --
  Xqci adds saturating arithmetic instructions to improve performance of fixed-point calculations.
  --

  Xqci adds 16, 32, and 48-bit instruction encodings. The 16 and 32-bit encodings are allocated
  in the custom opcode space so as not to conflict with standard RISC-V instructions. The 48-bit instructions
  follow the guidance for 48-bit instructions in the RISC-V standard, but are not allocated in reserved custom
  space since no such space has been defined by RISC-V International.

  Extension-specific instruction formats ::
