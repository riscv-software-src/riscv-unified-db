  description: |
    The Xqciu extension includes a set of instructions that improve RISC-V code density and
    performance in microontrollers. It fills several gaps:

    Long immediates::
    --
    This extension provides wide-immediate versions of
    loads, stores, branches, jumps, and several arithemtic operations.
    --

    Addressing modes::
    --
    New indexed addressing modes are added for load and store instructions.
    --

    Load/store multiple::
    --
    Xqciu adds instructions that load multiple sequential values from memory into multiple registers.
    Analogous instructions for stores are also included.
    --

    Branch immediate instructions::
    --
    The base RISC-V ISA provides conditional branches that compare two register values.
    Xqciu adds conditional branch instructions that compare an immediate value to a register value,
    reducing a common code sequence into a single instruction.
    --

    Conditional instructions::
    --
    Xqciu includes a variety of conditional select instructions that pick one of two operand values based on the result of a condition
    and conditional move instructions that either move a value or retain a value in a destination register based on the result of a condition.
    Conditional select and conditional move instructions help reduce code size and avoid branches in common code sequences.
    --

    Extra bit manipulation instructions::
    --
    Xqciu expands upon the standard `B` extension by adding instructions for
    bit insertion/extraction, bit set/clear, sign and zero extension, and bit counting instructions.
    --

    Fast interrupt instructions::
    --
    Xqciu adds instructions to accelerate interrupt handling, including instructions to quickly
    enable/disable interrupts and instructions to automatically save an interrupt frame.
    --

    Saturating arithemtic::
    --
    Xqciu adds saturating arithmetic instructions to improve performance of fixed-point calculations.
    --

    Xqciu adds 16, 32, and 48-bit instruction encodings. The 16 and 32-bit encodings are allocated
    in the custom opcode space so as not to conflict with standard RISC-V instructions. The 48-bit instructions
    follow the guidance for 48-bit instructions in the RISC-V standard, but are not allocated in reserved custom
    space since no such space has been defined by RISC-V International.
