  # This allows the action to be used in a fork-based workflow, where
  # e.g. you want to accept pull requests in a public repository.
  # In this case, the configuration from the main branch of your repository will be used for the
  # check. This means that you need to have this configuration in the main branch for the action to
  # run at all (e.g. it won't run within a PR that adds the action initially).
  # Also if you change the configuration in a PR, the changes will not be reflected for the current
  # PR â€“ only subsequent ones after the changes are in the main branch.
