= UnifiedDB Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to UnifiedDB!
We welcome all contributions that meet our xref:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[code of conduct].

== Ways to contribute

=== Bug Reports

Bug reports should be filed as a https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db/issues[GitHub Issue] using the `Bug report` template.

=== Feature Requests

Bug reports should be filed as a https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db/issues[GitHub Issue] using the `Feature request` template.

=== Bug Fixes

Bug fixes should be submitted as a Pull Request.

There should be a corresponding https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db/issues[GitHub Issue] for the PR. Ensure the two are linked by adding "closes #<issue number>" in the PR description.

=== New data, tools, and features

New data (for example, adding an extension), tools, or features should be submitted as a Pull Request.

There should be a corresponding https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db/issues[GitHub Issue] for the PR. Ensure the two are linked by adding "closes #<issue number>" in the PR description.

== Submitting a Pull Request

All patches must meet the UnifiedDB code standards. This includes:

* Pass regression tests (run locally as `./do test:regress`)
* Use appropriate commit messages
* Go through code review as a Pull Request

=== Regression tests

All contributions must pass the full suite of regression tests.
Regression tests are checked in GitHub for every PR, and they can also be run locally using `./do test:regress`.

If a Pull Request adds a new feature that is not already covered by the regression test suite, it
must add at least one new test.

=== Commit messages

UnifiedDB adheres to https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0[Conventional Commits v1.0.0].

The guidelines below are adapted from https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md[the Angular commit message guidelines].

Every commit message consists of a mandatory *header*, a mandatory *body*, and an optional *footer*.

```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

A template for commit messages is stored in xref:.gitmessage[], and will be installed automatically through the standard UnifiedDB setup script so that it appears when executing `git commit`.

==== Header

.UnifiedDB commit header format
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Optional Commit Scope: single word describing the component
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: e.g., build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|revert|style|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory. The `<scope>` field is optional.

==== Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

Explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message should explain
_why_ you are making the change.
You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate
the impact of the change.

==== Footer

A footer is required when the commit introduces a breaking change, closes a GitHub issue,
or has relevant git trailers.

===== Breaking change

When a commit introduces a breaking change to _any_ component, the commit message *must* include
a breaking change note in the footer:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<breaking change description + migration instructions>
```

==== Linked Issues and PRs

When a commit will close a GitHub Issue, it should be noted in the footer:

```
Fixes #<issue number>
Closes #<issue numer>
```

==== Git trailers

When any of the extra information is relevant to a commit, it should be marked with a git trailer.
Standard trailers for UnifiedDB include:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
| Key | Value format | Description
| Co-authored-by | Firstname Lastname <email> | A person, other than the committer, that authored part of the patch
|===

==== Examples

The following are examples of good commit messages:

```
data(ext): add Smclic extension

Add metadata and IDL for Smclic (Core Local Interrupt Controller) v1.0.

Closes #816
```

```

Closes #490
```

```
feat(ruby-db): add Sorbet type checking

Closes #934
Co-authored-by: Frank the Tank <frank@oldschool.movie>
```

=== Code review

All Pull Requests must go through the code review process.

All Pull Requests require approval by at least one Code Owner.

Code Owners are maintained in `.github/CODEOWNERS`.

== Finding tasks

If you are looking to contribute but are unsure what to do, browse through the https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db/issues[issues]. We try to keep them tagged by area and mark easier tasks with "good first issue".
