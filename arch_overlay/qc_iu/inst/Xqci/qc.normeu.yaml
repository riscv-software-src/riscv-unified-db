long_name: Unsigned Even Normalization
description: |
  Unsigned even normalization of `rs1` (exponent is even).
  Even exponent written in bits[7:0] of the result.
  Mantissa (based on even exponent) written in bits[31:8] of the result.
  Write result to `rd`.
  Instruction encoded in I instruction format.
