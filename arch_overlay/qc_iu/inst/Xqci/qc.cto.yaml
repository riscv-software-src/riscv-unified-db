description: |
  Count the number of ones before the first zero in `rs1`, starting from the LSB
  and progressing to the MSB.
  Accordingly, if the input is ~0, the output is XLEN, and if the least-significant
  bit of the input is a 0, the output is 0.
  Output written to `rd`.
  Instruction encoded in I instruction format.
