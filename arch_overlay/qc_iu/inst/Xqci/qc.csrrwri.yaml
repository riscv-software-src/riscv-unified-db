long_name: Atomic Read/Write CSR (Register) Immediate
description: |
  Atomically write CSR using a 5-bit immediate `imm`, and load the previous value into `rd`.
  Read the old value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to `XLEN` bits,
  and then write it to integer register `rd`.
  The CSR number is in `rs2` register.
  The 5-bit uimm field is zero-extended and written to the CSR.
  If `rd`=`x0`, then the instruction shall not read the CSR and shall not
  cause any of the side effects that might occur on a CSR read.
  Instruction encoded in R instruction format.
