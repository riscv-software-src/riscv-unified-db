      The `fsd` instruction stores a double-precision value from the floating-point registers to memory. It is guaranteed to execute
      atomically if the effective address is naturally aligned and XLENâ‰¥64. It doesn't modify the bits being transferred; in particular,
      the payloads of non-canonical NaNs are preserved.
