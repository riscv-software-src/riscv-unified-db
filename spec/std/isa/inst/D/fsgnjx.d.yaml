      `fsgnjx.d` instruction produces a result that takes all bits except the sign bit from _fs1_.
      The result's sign bit is the XOR of sign bits of _fs1_ and _fs2_, and the result is written to
      the destination register _fd_. `fsgnjx.d` does not set floating-point exception flags, nor do
      they canonicalize _NaN_s.
