      The `fsgnjx.d` instruction produces a result that takes all bits except the sign bit from `fs1`.
      The result's sign bit is the XOR of sign bits of `fs1` and `fs2`, and the result is written to
      the destination register `fd`. Sign-injection instructions do not set floating-point exception
      flags, nor do they canonicalize NaNs.
