long_name: Floating-Point Move High Half from Double-Precision Register to Integer Register
description:
  - id: inst-fmvh.x.d-behaviour
    normative: false
    text: |
      The `fmvh.x.d` instruction moves bits 63:32 of floating-point register `fs1` into integer register `xd`. `fmvh.x.d`
      is used in conjunction with the existing `fmv.x.w` instruction to move a double-precision floating-point number to a
      pair of integer-registers.
