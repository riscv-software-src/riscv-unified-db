long_name: Floating-Point Move Pair from Integer Registers to Double-Precision Register
description:
  - id: inst-fmvp.d.x-behaviour
    normative: false
    text: |
      The `fmvp.d.x` instruction moves a double-precision number from a pair of integer registers into a floating-point
      register. Integer registers `xs1` and `xs2` supply bits 31:0 and 63:32, respectively; the result is written to
      floating-point register `fd`.
