      `FSGNJN.D` instruction produces a result that takes all bits except the sign bit from _fs1_.
      The result's sign bit is opposite of _fs2_'s sign bit, and the result is written to the destination
      register _fd_. `FSGNJN.D` does not set floating-point exception flags, nor do they canonicalize _NaN_s.
