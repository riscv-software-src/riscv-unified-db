      The `fmin.d` instruction writes smaller of `fs1` and `fs2` to `fd`. For the purposes of this instruction,
      the value `-0.0` is considered to be less than the value `+0.0`. If both inputs are NaNs, the result is
      the canonical NaN. If only one operand is a NaN, the result is the non-NaN operand. Signaling NaN inputs
      set the invalid operation exception flag, even when the result is not NaN.
