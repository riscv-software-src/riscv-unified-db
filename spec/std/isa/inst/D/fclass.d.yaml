      The `fclass.d` instruction is defined analogously to its single-precision counterpart, but operates on double-precision
      operands. It examines the value in floating-point register `fs1` and writes to integer register `xd` a 10-bit mask that
      indicates the class of the floating point number.

      The format of the mask is described in the table below. The corresponding bit in `xd` will be set if the property
      is true and clear otherwise. All other bits in `xd` are cleared. Note that exactly one bit in `xd` will be set.

      .Format of result of `fclass` instruction.
