long_name: Atomic Compare-and-Swap Word
description: |
  For RV32, AMOCAS.W atomically loads a 32-bit data value from address in xs1,
  compares the loaded value to the 32-bit value held in xd, and if the
  comparison is bitwise equal, then stores the 32-bit value held in xs2 to the
  original address in xs1. The value loaded from memory is placed into
  register xd.

  For RV64, AMOCAS.W atomically loads a 32-bit data value from address in xs1,
  compares the loaded value to the lower 32 bits of the value held in xd, and
  if the comparison is bitwise equal, then stores the lower 32 bits of the
  value held in xs2 to the original address in xs1. The 32-bit value loaded
  from memory is sign-extended and is placed into register xd.

  Just as for AMOs in the A extension, AMOCAS.W requires that the address held
  in xs1 be naturally aligned to the size of the operand (i.e., four-byte
  aligned for words). And the same exception options apply if the address is
  not naturally aligned.

  Just as for AMOs in the A extension, the AMOCAS.W optionally provides release
  consistency semantics, using the aq and rl bits, to help implement
  multiprocessor synchronization. The memory operation performed by an
  AMOCAS.W, when successful, has acquire semantics if aq bit is 1 and has
  release semantics if rl bit is 1. The memory operation performed by an
  AMOCAS.W/D/Q, when not successful, has acquire semantics if aq bit is 1 but
  does not have release semantics, regardless of rl.

  A FENCE instruction may be used to order the memory read access and, if
  produced, the memory write access by an AMOCAS.W instruction.

  [Note] An unsuccessful AMOCAS.W may either not perform a memory write or may
  write back the old value loaded from memory. The memory write, if produced,
  does not have release semantics, regardless of rl.

  An AMOCAS.W instruction always requires write permissions.
