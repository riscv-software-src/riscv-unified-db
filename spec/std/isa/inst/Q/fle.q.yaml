      The `fle.q` performs the specified comparison between floating-point registers `fs1` and `fs2`,
      and writes 1 to integer register `xd` if the condition holds, and 0 otherwise.

      `fle.q` performs what the IEEE 754-2008 standard refers to as signaling comparisons: that is,
      they set the invalid operation exception flag if either input is _NaN_.
      The result is 0 if either operand is _NaN_.
