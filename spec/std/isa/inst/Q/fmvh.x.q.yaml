long_name: Floating-Point Move High Half to Integer from Quad-Precision

    normative: false
    text: |
      The `fmvh.x.q` instruction moves bits `127:64` of floating-point register `fs1` into integer register `xd`.
      It is encoded in the OP-FP major opcode with _funct3_=0, _rs2_=1, and _funct7_=1110011.

      `fmvh.x.q` is used in conjunction with the existing `fmv.x.d` instruction to move a quad-precision floating-point
      number to a pair of x-registers.
