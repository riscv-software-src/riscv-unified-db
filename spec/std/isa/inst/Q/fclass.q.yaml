      The `fclass.q` instruction examines the value in floating-point register `rs1` and writes to integer
      register `rd` a 10-bit mask that indicates the class of the floating-point number.

      The format of the mask is described in table given below. The corresponding bit in `rd`
      will be set if the property is true and clear otherwise. All other bits in `rd` are cleared.

      Note that exactly one bit in `rd` will be set. `fclass.q` does not set the floating-point
      exception flags.

      .Format of result of `fclass` instruction.
