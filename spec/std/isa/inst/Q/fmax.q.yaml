      The `fmax.q` instruction writes the larger/maximum of `fs1` and `fs2` to `fd`.
      The value `-0.0` is considered to be less than the value `+0.0`.
      If both inputs are _NaN_s, the result is the canonical _NaN_.
      If only one operand is a _NaN_, the result is the non-_NaN_ operand.
      Signaling _NaN_ inputs set the invalid operation exception flag, even when the result is not _NaN_.
