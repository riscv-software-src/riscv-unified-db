      The `fsq` is the new variant of LOAD-FP, encoded with a new value for the `funct3`.

      `fsq` is only guaranteed to execute atomically if the effective address is naturally aligned XLEN=128.

      `fsq` does not modify the bits being transferred; in particular, the payloads of non-canonical
      _NaNs_ are preserved.
