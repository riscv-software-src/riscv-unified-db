      The `fminm.q` instruction, defined like `fmin.q`, writes the smaller/minimum of `fs1` and `fs2` to `fd`.
      The value `-0.0` is considered to be less than the value `+0.0`.
      If both inputs are _NaN_s, the result is the canonical _NaN_.
      If either input is _NaN_, the result is the canonical _NaN_.
      Signaling _NaN_ inputs set the invalid operation exception flag, even when the result is not _NaN_.
      This instruction is encoded like its `fminm.q` counterpart, but with instruction bit 14 set to 1.
