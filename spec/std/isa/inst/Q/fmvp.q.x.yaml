long_name: Floating-Point Move Pair from Integer Registers to Quad-Precision Register

    text: |
      The `fmvp.q.x` instruction moves a double-precision number from a pair of integer registers into
      a floating-point register.
      Integer registers xs1 and xs2 supply bits 63:0 and 127:64, respectively; the result is written to
      floating-point register `fd`.
      `fmvp.q.x` is encoded in the OP-FP major opcode with _funct3_=0 and _funct7_=1011011.
