      The `feq.q` performs the specified comparison between floating-point registers `fs1` and `fs2`,
      and writes 1 to integer register `xd` if the conditon hold, and 0 otherwise.

      `feq.q` performs a quiet comparison:
      it only sets the invalid operation exception flag if either input is a signaling _NaN_.
      The result is 0 if either operand is _NaN_.
