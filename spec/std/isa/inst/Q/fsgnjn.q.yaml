    text: |
      The `fsgnjn.q` instruction produces a result that takes all bits except the sign bit from `fs1`.
      The result's sign bit is opposite of `fs2`'s sign bit, and the result is written to the destination register `fd`.
      `fsgnjn.q` does not set floating-point exception flags, nor do they canonicalize _NaN_s.
