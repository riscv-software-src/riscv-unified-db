long_name: Cache block prefetch for data write
description: |
  A prefetch.w instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block whose
  effective address is the sum of the base address specified in xs1 and the
  sign-extended offset encoded in imm[11:0], where imm[4:0] equals 0b00000,
  is likely to be accessed by a data write (i.e. store) in the near future.
