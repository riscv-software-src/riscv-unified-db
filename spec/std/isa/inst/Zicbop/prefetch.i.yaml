long_name: Cache block prefetch for instruction fetch
description: |
  A prefetch.i instruction indicates to hardware that the cache block whose
  effective address is the sum of the base address specified in rs1 and the
  sign-extended offset encoded in imm[11:0], where imm[4:0] equals 0b00000,
  is likely to be accessed by an instruction fetch in the near future.
