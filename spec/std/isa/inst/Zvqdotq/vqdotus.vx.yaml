long_name: Vector 8-bit Unsigned-Signed Dot Product (vector-scalar)
description: |
  Vector quad widening unsigned-signed dot product instruction performing the dot product between a 4-element vector of 8-bit unsigned integer elements (vs2) and a scalar 4-element vector of 8-bit signed integer elements (xs1), accumulating the result into a 32-bit signed integer accumulator.

  This instruction is only defined for SEW=32. It works on an element group with four 8-bit values stored together in a 32-bit bundle. For each input bundle for the dot product there is a corresponding (same index) SEW-wide element in the accumulator source (and destination).

  The "q" in the mnemonic indicates that the instruction is quad-widening. The number of body bundles is determined by `vl`. The operation can be masked, each mask bit determines whether the corresponding element result is active or not.

  The operation performed is:
  ```
  vd[i] = vs2[i][0] * xs1[0] + vs2[i][1] * xs1[1] + vs2[i][2] * xs1[2] + vs2[i][3] * xs1[3] + vd[i]
  ```

  Where vs2[i] is a 32-bit bundle containing four 8-bit unsigned integers and xs1 contains four 8-bit signed integers in its lower 32 bits.

  #
  # This instruction performs a vector quad widening unsigned-signed dot product (vector-scalar):
  # - SEW must be 32
  # - vs2 contains 8-bit unsigned integers, xs1 contains 8-bit signed integers
  # - Accumulates results into 32-bit signed integer accumulators
  # - Supports masking operations
  #
  # Operation: vd[i] = unsigned(vs2[i][0]) * signed(xs1[0]) +
  #                    unsigned(vs2[i][1]) * signed(xs1[1]) +
  #                    unsigned(vs2[i][2]) * signed(xs1[2]) +
  #                    unsigned(vs2[i][3]) * signed(xs1[3]) + vd[i]
