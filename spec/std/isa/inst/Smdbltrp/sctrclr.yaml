description:
  - id: inst-sctrclr-operation
    normative: false
    text: |
      When `mstateen0.CTR`=1, the SCTRCLR instruction performs the following operations:

      * Zeroes all CTR Entry Registers, for all DEPTH values
      * Reset to Zero the optional CTR cycle counter where implemented
      ** `ctrdata.CC` and `ctrdata.CCV` bit fields.
  - id: inst-sctrclr-csr-effect
    normative: true
    text: |
      Any read of `ctrsource`, `ctrtarget`, or `ctrdata` that follows SCTRCLR, such that it precedes the next
      qualified control transfer, will return the value 0.
  - id: inst-sctrclr-after
    normative: true
    text: |
      Further, the first recorded transfer following SCTRCLR will have `ctrdata.CCV`=0.

      SCTRCLR execution causes an `IllegalInstruction` exception if:

      * `Smctr` is not implemented
      * The instruction is executed in S/VS/VU-mode and `Ssctr` is not implemented, or `mstateen0.CTR`=0
      * The instruction is executed in U-mode
  - id: inst-sctrclr-virtual
    normative: false
    text: |
      SCTRCLR execution  causes a `VirtualInstruciton` exception if `mstateen0.CTR`=1 and:
      
      * The instruction is executed in VS-mode and `hstateen0.CTR`=0
      * The instruction is executed in VU-mode
