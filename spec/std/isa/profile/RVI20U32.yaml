introduction: |
  This profile specifies the ISA features available to generic unprivileged
  execution environments.
extensions:
  I:
    presence: mandatory
    version: "~> 2.1"
    note: |
      RVI is the mandatory base ISA for RVA, and is little-endian.

      As per the unprivileged architecture specification, the `ecall`
      instruction causes a requested trap to the execution environment.

      Misaligned loads and stores might not be supported.

      The `fence.tso` instruction is mandatory.

      NOTE: The `fence.tso` instruction was incorrectly described as
      optional in the 2019 ratified specifications. However, `fence.tso` is
      encoded within the standard `fence` encoding such that implementations
      must treat it as a simple global fence if they do not natively support
      TSO-ordering optimizations.  As software can always assume without any
      penalty that `fence.tso` is being exploited by a hardware
      implementation, there is no advantage to making the instruction a
      profile option.  Later versions of the unprivileged ISA specifications
      correctly indicate that `fence.tso` is mandatory.
  A:
    presence: optional
    version: "= 2.1"
  C:
    presence: optional
    version: "= 2.0"
  D:
    presence: optional
    version: "= 2.2"
    note: |
      NOTE: The rationale to not include Q as a profile option is that
      quad-precision floating-point is unlikely to be implemented in
      hardware, and so we do not require or expect software to expend effort
      optimizing use of Q instructions in case they are present.
  F:
    presence: optional
    version: "= 2.2"
  M:
    presence: optional
    version: "= 2.0"
  Zicntr:
    presence: optional
    version: "= 2.0"
  Zihpm:
    presence: optional
    version: "= 2.0"
    note: |
      The number of counters is platform-specific.
  Zifencei:
    presence: optional
    version: "= 2.0"
recommendations:
  - text: |
      Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
      exceptions on attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes.
