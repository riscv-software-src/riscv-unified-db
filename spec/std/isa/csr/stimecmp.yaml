  The `stimecmp` CSR is a 64-bit register that holds the time value at which the next supervisor timer interrupt should be triggered.
  When the `time` CSR reaches or exceeds the value in `stimecmp`, a supervisor timer interrupt is triggered by setting the STIP bit in the `mip` CSR.

  The supervisor timer interrupt is enabled when the STIE bit in the `mie` CSR is set.

  This CSR is available when the Sstc extension is implemented and `menvcfg.STCE` is set.
  When `menvcfg.STCE` is clear, accessing this CSR will cause an `IllegalInstruction` exception.

  In virtualized environments, when executing in VS-mode, accesses to `stimecmp` are redirected to `vstimecmp`.

      *Timer Compare Value*

      64-bit value representing the time at which the next supervisor timer interrupt should be triggered.
      When `time` >= `stimecmp`, the supervisor timer interrupt pending bit (`mip.STIP`) is set.
