  The `seed` CSR exposes physical entropy directly to software. This register is useful for cryptographic
  applications and random number generation. Reads may have side effects depending on the implementation.

      Entropy bits returned from the physical entropy source.
      This field is WARL and read-only. On each read, the value may be consumed
      or updated depending on platform behavior (see `ZKR_READ_SIDE_EFFECTS`).
