  Controls exception delegation from HS-mode to VS-mode.

  By default, all traps at any privilege level are handled in M-mode, though M-mode usually uses
  the `medeleg` and `mideleg` CSRs to delegate some traps to HS-mode. The `hedeleg` and `hideleg`
  CSRs allow these traps to be further delegated to a VS-mode guest; their layout is the same as
  `medeleg` and `mideleg`.

  A synchronous trap that has been delegated to HS-mode (using `medeleg`)
  is further delegated to VS-mode if V=1 before the trap and the
  corresponding `hedeleg` bit is set. Each bit of `hedeleg` shall be
  either writable or read-only zero. Many bits of `hedeleg` are required
  specifically to be writable or zero. Bit 0, corresponding to
  instruction address misaligned exceptions, must be writable if
  IALIGN=32.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Requiring that certain bits of `hedeleg` be writable reduces some of the
  burden on a hypervisor to handle variations of implementation.
  ====

  When XLEN=32, `hedelegh` is a 32-bit read/write register
  that aliases bits 63:32 of `hedeleg`.
  Register `hedelegh` does not exist when XLEN=64.
