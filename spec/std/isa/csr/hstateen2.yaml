    normative: true
    text: |
      Each bit of a `stateen` CSR controls less-privileged access to an extension’s state,
      for an extension that was not deemed "worthy" of a full XS field in `sstatus` like the
      FS and VS fields for the F and V extensions.
  - id: csr-hstateen2-num-justification
    normative: false
    text: |
      The number of registers provided at each level is four because it is believed that
      4 * 64 = 256 bits for machine and hypervisor levels, and 4 * 32 = 128 bits for
      supervisor level, will be adequate for many years to come, perhaps for as long as
      the RISC-V ISA is in use.
      The exact number four is an attempted compromise between providing too few bits on
      the one hand and going overboard with CSRs that will never be used on the other.
  - id: csr-hstateen2-scope
    normative: true
    text: |
      The `stateen` registers at each level control access to state at all less-privileged
      levels, but not at its own level.
  - id: csr-hstateen2-effect
    normative: true
    text: |
      When a `stateen` CSR prevents access to state for a privilege mode, attempting to execute
      in that privilege mode an instruction that implicitly updates the state without reading
      it may or may not raise an illegal instruction or virtual instruction exception.
      Such cases must be disambiguated by being explicitly specified one way or the other.
      In some cases, the bits of the `stateen` CSRs will have a dual purpose as enables for the
      ISA extensions that introduce the controlled state.
  - id: csr-hstateen2-encodings
    normative: true
    text: |
      With the hypervisor extension, the `hstateen` CSRs have identical encodings to the `mstateen` CSRs,
      except controlling accesses for a virtual machine (from VS and VU modes).
  - id: csr-hstateen2-zero
    normative: true
    text: |
      For every bit in an `hstateen` CSR that is zero (whether read-only zero or set to zero),
      the same bit appears as read-only zero in `sstateen` when accessed in VS-mode.
  - id: csr-hstateen2-read-only
    normative: true
    text: |
      A bit in an `hstateen` CSR cannot be read-only one unless the same bit is read-only one
      in the matching `mstateen` CSR.
