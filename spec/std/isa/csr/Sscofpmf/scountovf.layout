description: |
  A 32-bit read-only register that contains shadow copies of the OF bits in the 29 `mhpmevent` CSRs
  (`mhpmevent3` - `mhpmevent31`) — where `scountovf` bit X corresponds to `mhpmeventX`.

  This register enables supervisor-level overflow interrupt handler
  software to quickly and easily determine which counter(s) have overflowed
  without needing to make an execution environment call up to M-mode.

  Read access to bit X is subject to the same `mcounteren` (or `mcounteren` and `hcounteren`)
  CSRs that mediate access to the `hpmcounter` CSRs by S-mode (or VS-mode).

  In M-mode, `scountovf` bit X is always readable.
  In S/HS-mode, `scountovf` bit X is readable when `mcounteren` bit X is set, and otherwise reads as zero.
  Similarly, in VS-mode, it is readable when both `mcounteren` and `hcounteren` bit X are set.
