  The `minstretcfg` CSR is a 64-bit machine-level register that configures privilege
  mode filtering for the `minstret` (Machine Instructions-Retired Counter). Each inhibit bit (xINH)
  disables counting of retired instructions in the associated privilege mode.

  | Field   | Description                                               |
  |---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | MINH    | If set, then counting of events in M-mode is inhibited.  |
  | SINH    | If set, then counting of events in S/HS-mode is inhibited. |
  | UINH    | If set, then counting of events in U-mode is inhibited.  |
  | VSINH   | If set, then counting of events in VS-mode is inhibited. |
  | VUINH   | If set, then counting of events in VU-mode is inhibited. |

  When all inhibit bits are clear, instruction retirement is counted in all privilege modes.

  For each bit in 61:58, if the associated privilege mode is not implemented, the bit is read-only zero.

  Bit 63 (OF) always reads as zero, indicating that the counter does not generate overflow interrupts.

  Bits [57:0] are reserved (WPRI) and read as zero; writes are ignored.

  For RV32 systems, the upper 32 bits of `minstretcfg` are accessible via the `minstretcfgh` CSR (0x722).
