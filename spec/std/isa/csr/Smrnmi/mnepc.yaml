    description: |
      When a NMI / double trap is taken into M-mode, `mnepc.PC` is written with the virtual address of the
      instruction that was interrupted or that encountered the exception.
      Otherwise, `mnepc.PC` is never written by the implementation, though it may be explicitly written
      by software.

      On an exception return from M-mode NMI / double trap (from the MNRET instruction),
      control transfers to the virtual address read out of `mnepc.PC`.

      [when,"ext?(:C)"]
      Because PCs are always halfword-aligned, bit 0 of `mnepc.PC` is always
      read-only 0.

      [when,"!ext?(:C)"]
      Because PCs are always word-aligned, bits 1:0 of `mnepc.PC` are always
      read-only 0.

      [when,"ext?(:C) && MUTABLE_MISA_C == true"]
      When `misa.C` is clear, bit 1 is masked to zero. Writes to bit 1 are still captured, and
      may be visible on the next read with `misa.C` is set.
