      M-mode NMI Previous Privilege.

      Written by hardware in two cases:

      * Written with the prior nominal privilege level when entering M-mode NMI from an exception/interrupt.
      * Written with 0 when executing an `mnret` instruction to return from a double exception / NMI in M-mode.

      Can also be written by software without immediate side-effect.

      Affects execution in two cases:

      * On a return from a double exception / NMI from M-mode, the machine will
      enter the privilege level stored in MNPP before clearing the field.
      * When `mnstatus.MNPRV` is set, loads and stores behave as if the current privilege level were MNPP.

      *Machine Previous NMI Virtualization mode*

      Written with the prior virtualization mode when entering M-mode from an exception/interrupt.
      When returning via an MRET instruction, the virtualization mode becomes the value of MPV unless MPP=3, in which case the virtualization mode is always 0.
      Can also be written by software.

      *M-mode NMI Enable*

      Written by hardware in two cases:

      * Written with the value 0 when entering M-mode NMI.
      * Written with the value 0 when entering M-mode double trap.

      Written by software in one case only:

      * The NMIE is 0 on reset for boot code to initialize system to service NMIs. Once SW writes NMIE to 1, it cannot be changed anymore by SW.

      Affects execution by:

      * When 0, all non-maskable interrupts and exceptions are disabled when the current privilege level is M.
      * When 1, NMI or double trap is possible.
