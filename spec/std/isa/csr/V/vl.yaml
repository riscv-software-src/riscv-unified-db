    description: |
      The vl register holds an unsigned integer specifying the number of elements to be updated with
      results from a vector instruction, as further detailed in Section Section 31.5.4.

      [NOTE]
      The number of bits implemented in vl depends on the implementation's maximum vector
      length of the smallest supported type. The smallest vector implementation with VLEN=32
      and supporting SEW=8 would need at least six bits in vl to hold the values 0-32
      (VLEN=32, with LMUL=8 and SEW=8, yields VLMAX=32).
