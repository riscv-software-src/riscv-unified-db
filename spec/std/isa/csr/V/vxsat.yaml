    description: |
      The vxsat CSR has a single read-write least-significant bit (vxsat[0]) that indicates if a fixed-point
      instruction has had to saturate an output value to fit into a destination format. Bits vxsat[XLEN-1:1]
      should be written as zeros.

      The vxsat bit is mirrored in vcsr.
