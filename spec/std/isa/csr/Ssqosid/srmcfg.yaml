  - id: csr-srmcfg-purpose
    normative: true
    text: |
      The `srmcfg` register is used to configure a Resource Control ID (`RCID`) and a Monitoring Counter ID (`MCID`).
      Both `RCID` and `MCID` are WARL fields.

  - id: csr-`srmcfg`-field-usage
    normative: true
    text: |
      The `RCID` and `MCID` accompany each request made by the hart to shared resource controllers.
      The `RCID` is used to determine the resource allocations (e.g., cache occupancy limits, memory bandwidth limits, etc.) to enforce.
      The `MCID` is used to identify a counter to monitor resource usage.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-default-scope
    normative: true
    text: |
      The `RCID` and `MCID` configured in the `srmcfg` CSR apply to all privilege modes of software execution on that hart by default,
      but this behavior may be overridden by future extensions.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-smstateen-interaction
    normative: true
    text: |
      If extension `Smstateen` is implemented together with `Ssqosid`, then `Ssqosid` also requires the `SRMCFG` bit in `mstateen0` to be implemented.
      If `mstateen0.SRMCFG` is `0`, attempts to access `srmcfg` in privilege modes less privileged than M-mode raise an illegal-instruction exception.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-vsmode-exception
    normative: true
    text: |
      If `mstateen0.SRMCFG` is `1` or if extension `Smstateen` is not implemented, attempts to access `srmcfg` when `V=1` raise a virtual-instruction exception.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-rcid-reset
    normative: false
    text: |
      A reset value of `0` is suggested for the `RCID` field, matching resource controllers' default behavior of associating all capacity with `RCID=0`.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-mcid-reset
    normative: false
    text: |
      The `MCID` reset value does not affect functionality and may be implementation-defined.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-id-bit-allocation
    normative: false
    text: |
      Typically, fewer bits are allocated for `RCID` (e.g., to support tens of `RCID`s) than for `MCID` (e.g., to support hundreds of `MCID`s).

  - id: csr-srmcfg-rcid-grouping
    normative: false
    text: |
      A common `RCID` is usually used to group apps or VMs, pooling resource allocations to meet collective SLAs.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-mcid-granularity
    normative: false
    text: |
      If an SLA breach occurs, unique `MCID`s enable granular monitoring, aiding decisions on resource adjustment,
      associating a different `RCID` with a subset of members, or migrating members to other machines.
      The larger pool of `MCID`s speeds up this analysis.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-privilege-behavior
    normative: false
    text: |
      The `RCID` and `MCID` in `srmcfg` apply across all privilege levels on the hart.
      Typically, higher-privilege modes don't modify `srmcfg`, as they often serve lower-privileged tasks.
      If differentiation is needed, higher privilege code can update `srmcfg` and restore it before returning to a lower privilege level.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-vm-virtualization
    normative: false
    text: |
      In VM environments, hypervisors usually manage resource allocations, keeping the Guest OS out of QoS flows.
      If needed, the hypervisor can virtualize the `srmcfg` CSR for a VM using the virtual-instruction exceptions triggered upon Guest access.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-vs-mode-future
    normative: false
    text: |
      If the direct selection of `RCID` and `MCID` by the VM becomes common and emulation overhead is an issue,
      future extensions may allow VS-mode to use a selector for a hypervisor-configured set of CSRs holding `RCID` and `MCID` values designated for that Guest OS use.

  - id: csr-srmcfg-context-switch
    normative: false
    text: |
      During context switches, the supervisor may choose to execute with the `srmcfg` of the outgoing context to attribute the execution to it.
      Prior to restoring the new context, it switches to the new VM’s `srmcfg`.
      The supervisor can also use a separate configuration for execution not to be attributed to either context.
