  Reports the vendor-specific implementation ID.

  The `mimpid` CSR provides a unique encoding of the version of the
  processor implementation. This register must be readable in any
  implementation, but a value of 0 can be returned to indicate that the
  field is not implemented. The Implementation value should reflect the
  design of the RISC-V processor itself and not any surrounding system.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  The format of this field is left to the provider of the architecture
  source code, but will often be printed by standard tools as a
  hexadecimal string without any leading or trailing zeros, so the
  Implementation value can be left-justified (i.e., filled in from
  most-significant nibble down) with subfields aligned on nibble
  boundaries to ease human readability.
