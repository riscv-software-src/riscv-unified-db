  - id: csr-fflags-purpose
    normative: true
    text: |
      The accrued exception flags indicate the exception conditions that have arisen on any floating-point arithmetic
      instruction since the field was last reset by software.
  - id: csr-fflags-fptrap
    normative: false
    text: The base RISC-V ISA does not support generating a trap on the setting of a floating-point exception flag.
  - id: csr-fflags-reasoning
    normative: false
    text: |
      As allowed by the standard, we do not support traps on floating-point exceptions in the F
      extension, but instead require explicit checks of the flags in software. We considered
      adding branches controlled directly by the contents of the floating-point accrued
      exception flags, but ultimately chose to omit these instructions to keep the ISA simple.
