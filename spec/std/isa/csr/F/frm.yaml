      Rounding modes are encoded as follows:

      [[rm]]
      .Rounding mode encoding.
      [%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="^,^,<",options="header"]
      !===
      !Rounding Mode |Mnemonic |Meaning
      !000 !RNE !Round to Nearest, ties to Even
      !001 !RTZ !Round towards Zero
      !010 !RDN !Round Down (towards latexmath:[$-\infty$])
      !011 !RUP !Round Up (towards latexmath:[$+\infty$])
      !100 !RMM !Round to Nearest, ties to Max Magnitude
      !101 ! !_Reserved for future use._
      !110 ! !_Reserved for future use._
      !111 !DYN !In instruction's _rm_ field, selects dynamic rounding mode; In Rounding Mode register, _reserved_.

    normative: false
    text: |
      The behavior of floating-point instructions that depend on rounding mode when
      executed with a reserved rounding mode is _reserved_, including both static
      reserved rounding modes (101-110) and dynamic reserved rounding modes (101-111).
  - id: csr-frm-rmfield
    normative: false
    text: |
      Some instructions, including widening conversions, have the _rm_ field but are
      nevertheless mathematically unaffected by the rounding mode; software should set
      their _rm_ field to RNE (000) but implementations must treat the _rm_ field as
      usual (in particular, with regard to decoding legal vs. reserved encodings).
