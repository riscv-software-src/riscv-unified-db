  This register provides access to the trigger selected by `tselect`.
  The reset values listed here apply to every underlying trigger.

  This register is optional if no triggers are implemented.
  Writing 0 to this register must result in a trigger that is disabled.
  If this trigger supports multiple types, then the hardware should disable it
  by changing type to 15.

      0 (none):: There is no trigger at this `tselect`.
      1 (legacy):: The trigger is a legacy SiFive address match trigger. These should not be implemented and aren’t further documented here.
      2 (mcontrol):: The trigger is an address/data match trigger. The remaining bits in this register act as described in `mcontrol`.
      3 (icount):: The trigger is an instruction count trigger. The remaining bits in this register act as described in `icount`.
      4 (itrigger):: The trigger is an interrupt trigger. The remaining bits in this register act as described in `itrigger`.
      5 (etrigger):: The trigger is an exception trigger. The remaining bits in this register act as described in `etrigger`.
      6 (mcontrol6):: The trigger is an address/data match trigger. The remaining bits in this register act as described in `mcontrol6`. This is similar to a type 2 trigger, but provides additional functionality and should be used instead of type 2 in newer implementations.
      7 (tmexttrigger):: The trigger is a trigger source external to the TM. The remaining bits in this register act as described in `tmexttrigger`.
      12—14 (custom):: These trigger types are available for non-standard use.
      15 (disabled):: This trigger is disabled. In this state, `tdata2` and `tdata3` can be written with any value that is supported for any of the types this trigger implements. The remaining bits in this register, except for `DMODE`, are ignored.

      Other values are reserved for future use.

      If type is 0, then this bit is hard-wired to 0.

      0 (both): Both Debug and M-mode can write the `tdata` registers at the selected `tselect`.
      1 (dmode): Only Debug Mode can write the `tdata` registers at the selected `tselect`. Writes from other modes are ignored.

      This bit is only writable from Debug Mode. In ordinary
      use, external debuggers will always set this bit when
      configuring a trigger. When clearing this bit, debuggers
      should also set the action field (whose location depends on
      type) to something other than 1.
