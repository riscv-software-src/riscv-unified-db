      Written with trap-specific information when a trap is taken into VS-mode.

      The values are:

      [separator="!"]
      !===
      ! Exception type ! Value

      ! [0] Instruction address misaligned ! The misaligned virtual PC (same as the value written to `mepc`).
      ! [1] Instruction access fault ! The <% if ext?(:C) %> portion of the <% end %> virtual PC causing the access fault <%- unless ext?(:C) -%>(same as the value written to `mepc`)<%- end -%>.
      ! [2] Illegal Instruction ! The encoding of the illegal instruction.
      ! [3] Breakpoint
      a! [when,"REPORT_VA_IN_VSTVAL_ON_BREAKPOINT == true"]
        When caused by an EBREAK instruction, the virtual PC of the breakpoint instruction.

        [when,"REPORT_VA_IN_VSTVAL_ON_BREAKPOINT == false"]
        When caused by an EBREAK instruction, zero.

        When caused by a data address (_i.e._, watchpoint) breakpoint, the faulting virtual address.
        When caused by an instruction address breakpoint, the faulting virtual PC.
      ! [4] Load address misaligned ! The misaligned virtual load address.
      ! [5] Load access fault
      ! The part of virtual load address causing in the access fault.

        When the load is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
        (_e.g._, if an 8-byte load is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page,
        address + 4 is reported).

        (Even though the access fault arises on a physical address, the virtual address is reported)
      ! [6] Store/AMO address misaligned ! The misaligned virtual store/AMO address.
      ! [7] Store/AMO access fault
      ! The virtual store/AMO address causing the access fault.

        When the store/AMO is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
        (_e.g._, if an 8-byte store is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page,
        address + 4 is reported).

        (Even though the access fault arises on a physical address, the virtual address is reported)
      ! [8] Environment call from U-mode <% if ext?(:H) %>or VU-mode<% end %> ! Zero
      ! [9] Environment call from (H)S-mode ! Zero
      <%- if ext?(:H) -%>
      ! [10] Environment call from VS-mode ! Zero
      <%- end -%>
      ! [12] Instruction page fault
      ! The <% if ext?(:C) %> portion of the <% end %> virtual PC causing the page fault
        <% unless ext?(:C) %>(same as the value written to `mepc`)<% end %>.
      ! [13] Load page fault
      ! The part of the virtual load address causing in the page fault.

        When the load is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
        (_e.g._, if an 8-byte load is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page, address + 4 is reported).
      ! [15] Store/AMO page fault
      ! The virtual store/AMO address causing in the page fault.

        When the store/AMO is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
        (_e.g._, if an 8-byte store is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page, address + 4 is reported).
      <%- if ext?(:H) -%>
      ! [20] Instruction guest-page fault
      ! The <% if ext?(:C) %> portion of the <% end %> virtual PC causing the fault <% unless ext?(:C) %>(same as the value written to `mepc`)<% end %>.

        The guest physical address is reported in `mtval2`.
      ! [21] Load guest-page fault
      ! The part of the virtual address causing the fault.

        When the load is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
        (_e.g._, if an 8-byte load is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page, address + 4 is reported).

        The guest physical address is reported in `mtval2`.
      ! [22] Virtual instruction
      ! The encoding of the faulting virtual instruction.
      ! [23] Store/AMO guest-page fault
      ! The part of the virtual address causing the fault.

        When the store/AMO is misaligned, the reported value is the smallest address on the page causing a fault
        (_e.g._, if an 8-byte store is equally split across a page and the fault occurs on the second page, address + 4 is reported).

        The guest physical address is reported in `htval`.
