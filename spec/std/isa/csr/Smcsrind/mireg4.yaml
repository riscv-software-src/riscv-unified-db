    normative: true

      The `mireg4` machine indirect alias CSR is used to access register state indirectly
      upon a read or write, as determined by the value of `miselect`.

  - id: csr-mireg4-unimplemented-miselect
    normative: true
    text: |
      The behavior upon accessing `mireg4` from M-mode, while `miselect` holds a value
      that is not implemented, is UNSPECIFIED.

  - id: csr-mireg4-unimplemented-miselect-note
    normative: false
    text: |
      It is expected that implementations will typically raise an illegal instruction exception for
      such accesses, so that, for example, they can be identified as software bugs. Platform
      specs, profile specs, and/or the Privileged ISA spec may place more restrictions on
      behavior for such accesses.

  - id: csr-mireg4-implemented-miselect
    normative: true
    text: |
      Attempts to access `mireg4` while `miselect` holds a number in an allocated and implemented
      range results in a specific behavior that, for each combination of `miselect` and `mireg4`, is
      defined by the extension to which the `miselect` value is allocated.

  - id: csr-mireg4-implemented-miselect-note
    normative: false
    text: |
      Ordinarily, `mireg4` will access register state, access read-only 0 state, or raise an
      illegal instruction exception.

  - id: csr-mireg4-rv32-64bit-access
    normative: false
    text: |
      For RV32, if an extension defines an indirectly accessed register as 64 bits wide, it is
      recommended that the upper 32 bits of the register are accessed through `mireg4`,
      while the lower 32 bits are accessed through `mireg`, `mireg2`, or `mireg3`.
