      The mireg machine indirect alias CSR is used to access another CSR's state
      indirectly upon a read or write, as determined by the value of miselect.
  - id: csr-mireg-unimplemented-miselect
    normative: true
    text: |
      The behavior upon accessing mireg from M-mode, while miselect holds a value
      that is not implemented, is UNSPECIFIED.
  - id: csr-mireg-unimplemented-miselect-note
    normative: false
    text: |
      It is expected that implementations will typically raise an illegal instruction exception for
      such accesses, so that, for example, they can be identified as software bugs. Platform
      specs, profile specs, and/or the Privileged ISA spec may place more restrictions on
      behavior for such accesses.
  - id: csr-mireg-implemented-miselect
    normative: true
    text: |
      Attempts to access mireg while miselect holds a number in an allocated and implemented range
      results in a specific behavior that, for each combination of miselect and mireg, is defined by the
      extension to which the miselect value is allocated.
  - id: csr-mireg-implemented-miselect-note
    normative: false
    text: |
      Ordinarily, mireg will access register state, access read-only 0 state, or raise an
      illegal instruction exception.
  - id: csr-mireg-rv32-64bit-access
    normative: false
    text: |
      For RV32, if an extension defines an indirectly accessed register as 64 bits wide, it is
      recommended that the lower 32 bits of the register are accessed through mireg,
      while the upper 32 bits are accessed through mireg4.
