      The `siselect` register will support the value range 0..0xFFF at a minimum. A future extension may
      define a value range outside of this minimum range. Only if such an extension is implemented will
      `siselect` be required to support larger values.

  - id: csr-siselect-emulation
    normative: false
    text: |
      Requiring a range of 0-0xFFF for `siselect`, even though most or all of the space may be reserved or
      inaccessible, permits M-mode to emulate indirectly accessed registers in this implemented range,
      including registers that may be standardized in the future.

  - id: csr-siselect-msb
    normative: true
    text: |
      Values of `siselect` with the most-significant bit set (bit XLEN - 1 = 1) are designated only for
      custom use, presumably for accessing custom registers through the alias CSRs. Values of `siselect`
      with the most-significant bit clear are designated only for standard use and are reserved until
      allocated to a standard architecture extension. If XLEN is changed, the most-significant bit of
      `siselect` moves to the new position, retaining its value from before.
