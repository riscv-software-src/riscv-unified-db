description: |
  The `vsireg4` CSR is one of several alias registers used to indirectly access
  virtual supervisor-level CSRs in VS-mode or VU-mode.

  The register addressed by `vsireg4` is selected by the current value of the `vsiselect` CSR.

  The alias mechanism allows indirect CSR access, which helps in virtualization and future extensibility.

  A virtual instruction exception is raised for attempts from VS-mode or VU-mode
  to directly access `vsiselect` or `vsireg4`, or from VU-mode to access `siselect` or `siregX`.

  The behavior of accesses to `vsireg4` when `vsiselect` holds a value that is
  not implemented at the HS level is UNSPECIFIED.

  Implementations are recommended to raise an illegal instruction exception for
  accesses to unimplemented targets via `vsireg4`.

  The width of `vsireg4` is always the current `XLEN`, not `VSXLEN`.
  For example, if `HSXLEN = 64` and `VSXLEN = 32`, then `vsireg4` is 64 bits wide
  when accessed from HS-mode (RV64), but 32 bits when accessed from VS-mode (RV32).
