  - id: csr-vsiselect-range-minimum
    normative: true
    text: |
      The `vsiselect` register will support the value range 0..0xFFF at a minimum.
      A future extension may define a value range outside of this minimum range.
      Only if such an extension is implemented will `vsiselect` be required to support larger values.

  - id: csr-vsiselect-hypervisor-emulation
    normative: true
    text: |
      Requiring a range of 0-0xFFF for `vsiselect`, even though most or all of the space may be reserved
      or inaccessible, permits a hypervisor to emulate indirectly accessed registers in this implemented
      range, including registers that may be standardized in the future.

  - id: csr-vsiselect-siselect-width-matching
    normative: false
    text: |
      It is recommended that `vsiselect` and `siselect` be implemented with the same number of bits.
      This avoids the creation of a virtualization hole due to observable differences between their widths.

  - id: csr-vsiselect-msb-custom-vs-standard
    normative: true
    text: |
      Values of `vsiselect` with the most-significant bit set (bit XLEN - 1 = 1) are designated only for
      custom use, presumably for accessing custom registers through the alias CSRs.
      Values with the most-significant bit clear are designated only for standard use and are reserved
      until allocated to a standard architecture extension.

  - id: csr-vsiselect-msb-behavior-xlen-change
    normative: true
    text: |
      If XLEN is changed, the most-significant bit of `vsiselect` moves to the new position,
      retaining its value from before.
