description: |
  This register determines which trigger is accessible through the other Trigger Module registers.

  It is optional if no triggers are implemented. The set of accessible triggers must start at 0,
  and be contiguous. This register is WARL. Writes of values greater than or equal to the number of
  supported triggers may result in a different value in this register than what was written or may
  point to a trigger where type=0.

  To verify that what they wrote is a valid index, debuggers can
  read back the value and check that tselect holds what they wrote and read tdata1 to see that type
  is non-zero. Since triggers can be used both by Debug Mode and M-mode, the external debugger must
  restore this register if it modifies it.
