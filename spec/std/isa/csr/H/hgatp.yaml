name: hgatp
long_name: Hypervisor guest address translation and protection
description: |
  The hgatp register is an HSXLEN-bit read/write register
  which controls G-stage address translation and protection, the second stage of two-stage
  translation for guest virtual addresses.
  Similar to CSR `satp`, this register holds the physical page number (PPN) of the
  guest-physical root page table;
  a virtual machine identifier (VMID), which facilitates address-translation fences on a
  per-virtual-machine basis;
  and the MODE field, which selects the address-translation scheme for guest physical addresses.
  When `mstatus.TVM`=1, attempts to read or write `hgatp` while executing in HS-mode will
  raise an `IllegalInstruction` exception.

  <<hgatp-mode>> shows the encodings of the MODE field when
  HSXLEN=32 and HSXLEN=64. When MODE=Bare, guest physical addresses are
  equal to supervisor physical addresses, and there is no further memory
  protection for a guest virtual machine beyond the physical memory
  protection scheme described in <<pmp>>. In this
  case, the remaining fields in `hgatp` must be set to zeros.

  Implementations are not required to support all defined MODE settings
  when HSXLEN=64.

  A write to `hgatp` with an unsupported MODE value is not ignored as it
  is for `satp`. Instead, the fields of `hgatp` are *WARL* in the normal way,
  when so indicated.

  As explained in <<guest-addr-translation>>, for the
  paged virtual-memory schemes (Sv32x4, Sv39x4, Sv48x4, and Sv57x4), the
  root page table is 16 KiB and must be aligned to a 16-KiB boundary. In
  these modes, the lowest two bits of the physical page number (PPN) in
  `hgatp` always read as zeros. An implementation that supports only the
  defined paged virtual-memory schemes and/or Bare may make PPN[1:0]
  read-only zero.

  The number of VMID bits is UNSPECIFIED and may be zero. The number of implemented
  VMID bits, termed _VMIDLEN_, may be determined by writing one to every
  bit position in the VMID field, then reading back the value in `hgatp`
  to see which bit positions in the VMID field hold a one. The
  least-significant bits of VMID are implemented first: that is, if
  VMIDLEN > 0, VMID[VMIDLEN-1:0] is writable. The maximal
  value of VMIDLEN, termed VMIDMAX, is 7 for Sv32x4 or 14 for Sv39x4,
  Sv48x4, and Sv57x4.

  The `hgatp` register is considered _active_ for the purposes of the
  address-translation algorithm _unless_ the effective privilege mode is U
  and `hstatus`.HU=0.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  This definition simplifies the implementation of speculative execution
  of `hlv`, `hlvx`, and 'hsv' instructions.
  ====

  Note that writing `hgatp` does not imply any ordering constraints
  between page-table updates and subsequent G-stage address translations.
  If the new virtual machine's guest physical page tables have been
  modified, or if a VMID is reused, it may be necessary to execute an
  HFENCE.GVMA instruction (see <<hfence.vma>>) before or
  after writing `hgatp`.

    description: |
      When MODE=Bare, guest physical addresses are equal to supervisor physical addresses,
      and there is no further memory protection for a guest virtual machine beyond the
      physical memory protection scheme.
      In this case, the remaining fields in hgatp must be set to zeros.

      When HSXLEN=32, the only other valid setting for MODE is Sv32x4, which is a
      modification of the usual Sv32 paged virtual-memory scheme, extended to support
      34-bit guest physical addresses.
      When HSXLEN=64, modes Sv39x4, Sv48x4, and Sv57x4 are defined as modifications of the
      Sv39, Sv48, and Sv57 paged virtual-memory schemes.

      A write to hgatp with an unsupported MODE value is not ignored as it is for `satp`.
      Instead, the fields of hgatp are WARL in the normal way, when so indicated.

      The number of VMID bits is determined by parameter VMID_WIDTH.
      VMID_WIDTH may be determined by software by writing one to every bit position in
