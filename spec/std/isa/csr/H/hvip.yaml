long_name: Hypervisor Virtual Interrupt Pending Register
description: |
  The `hvip` register is an HSXLEN-bit read/write register that a hypervisor can write to indicate virtual interrupts intended for VS-mode.
  It contains interrupt-pending bits for virtual interrupts such as VS-level external interrupts, timer interrupts, and software interrupts.
