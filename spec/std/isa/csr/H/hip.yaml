long_name: Hypervisor Interrupt Pending Register
description: |
  The `hip` register is an HSXLEN-bit read/write register that indicates pending interrupts at the hypervisor level.
  It contains interrupt-pending bits for both VS-level and hypervisor-specific interrupts.
address: 0x608
priv_mode: S
definedBy: H
length: SXLEN
fields:
  SGEIP:
    location: 12
    type: RO
    reset_value: 0
    description: |
      Pending interrupt bit for supervisor guest external interrupts (SGEI).
      This bit is 1 if and only if the logical AND of `hgeip` and `hgeie` is nonzero.

  VSEIP:
    location: 10
    type: RO
    reset_value: 0
    description: |
      Pending interrupt bit for VS-level external interrupts (VSEI).
      This bit is the logical OR of `vseip` from `hvip`, the interrupt from `hgeip` selected by `hstatus.VGEIN`,
      and any other external interrupt signal directed to VS-level.

  VSTIP:
    location: 6
    type: RO
    reset_value: 0
    description: |
      Pending interrupt bit for VS-level timer interrupts (VSTI).
      This bit is the logical OR of `vstip` from `hvip` and any other timer interrupt directed to VS-level.

  VSSIP:
    location: 2
    type: RO
    reset_value: 0
    description: |
      Pending interrupt bit for VS-level software interrupts (VSSI).
      This bit is an alias of the `vssip` bit in `hvip`.
