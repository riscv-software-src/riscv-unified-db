long_name: Hypervisor Interrupt Enable Register
description: |
  The `hie` register is a read/write register in HS-mode that enables interrupts.
  It corresponds to the enable bits for VS-level and hypervisor-specific interrupts, and supplements
  the HS-level `sie` register.

    description: |
      Hypervisor guest external interrupt enable bit. When set, allows external interrupts to be delivered
      to VS-mode based on the `hgeie` setting.

  VSEIE:
    location: 10
    type: RW-H
    reset_value: 0
    description: |
      VS-level external interrupt enable bit. When set, allows external interrupts directed to VS-level
      to be processed based on the configuration in `hvip` and other platform-specific sources.

    type: RW-H
    reset_value: 0
    description: |
      VS-level timer interrupt enable bit. When set, allows VS-level timer interrupts to be processed
      based on the `hvip` configuration and any platform-specific timer interrupts.

    type: RW-H
    reset_value: 0
    description: |
      VS-level software interrupt enable bit. When set, allows software interrupts directed to VS-level
      to be processed, based on the configuration in `hvip`.
