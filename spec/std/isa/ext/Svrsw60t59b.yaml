  == "Svrsw60t59b" Extension for PTE Reserved-for-Software Bits 60-59, Version 1.0

  If the Svrsw60t59b extension is implemented, then bits 60-59 of the page table
  entries (PTEs) are reserved for use by supervisor software and are ignored by
  the implementation.

  If the Hypervisor (H) extension is also implemented, then bits 60-59 of the
  G-stage PTEs are reserved for use by supervisor software and are ignored by the
  implementation.

  The Svrsw60t59b extension depends on Sv39.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Operating systems frequently use reserved bits within PTEs to store metadata for
  advanced memory management features. Embedding these metadata bits directly within
  the PTEs allows for fast access with minimal overhead, avoiding costly lookups in
  auxiliary data structures. By default, Sv39 and Sv39x4 require a page fault and
  a guest-page fault exception, respectively, to be raised if bits 60-59 are not
  zero.
