long_name: Carry-less multiplication for Cryptography
description: |
  Carry-less multiplication is the multiplication in the polynomial ring over GF(2).
  This is a critical operation in some cryptographic workloads, particularly the AES-GCM
  authenticated encryption scheme.
  This extension provides only the instructions needed to efficiently implement the GHASH operation,
  which is part of this workload.
