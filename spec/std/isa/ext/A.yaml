description: |

  The atomic-instruction extension, named `A`, contains
  instructions that atomically read-modify-write memory to support
  synchronization between multiple RISC-V harts running in the same memory
  space. The two forms of atomic instruction provided are
  load-reserved/store-conditional instructions and atomic fetch-and-op
  memory instructions. Both types of atomic instruction support various
  memory consistency orderings including unordered, acquire, release, and
  sequentially consistent semantics. These instructions allow RISC-V to
  support the RCsc memory consistency model. cite:[Gharachorloo90memoryconsistency]

  [NOTE]
  ====
  After much debate, the language community and architecture community
  appear to have finally settled on release consistency as the standard
  memory consistency model and so the RISC-V atomic support is built
  around this model.
  ====

  The `A` extension comprises instructions provided by the `Zaamo` and `Zalrsc`
  extensions.

  = Specifying Ordering of Atomic Instructions

  The base RISC-V ISA has a relaxed memory model, with the `FENCE`
  instruction used to impose additional ordering constraints. The address
  space is divided by the execution environment into memory and I/O
  domains, and the `FENCE` instruction provides options to order accesses to
  one or both of these two address domains.

  To provide more efficient support for release consistency cite:[Gharachorloo90memoryconsistency], each atomic
  instruction has two bits, _aq_ and _rl_, used to specify additional
  memory ordering constraints as viewed by other RISC-V harts. The bits
  order accesses to one of the two address domains, memory or I/O,
  depending on which address domain the atomic instruction is accessing.
  No ordering constraint is implied to accesses to the other domain, and a
  FENCE instruction should be used to order across both domains.

  If both bits are clear, no additional ordering constraints are imposed
  on the atomic memory operation. If only the _aq_ bit is set, the atomic
  memory operation is treated as an _acquire_ access, i.e., no following
  memory operations on this RISC-V hart can be observed to take place
  before the acquire memory operation. If only the _rl_ bit is set, the
  atomic memory operation is treated as a _release_ access, i.e., the
  release memory operation cannot be observed to take place before any
  earlier memory operations on this RISC-V hart. If both the _aq_ and _rl_
  bits are set, the atomic memory operation is _sequentially consistent_
  and cannot be observed to happen before any earlier memory operations or
  after any later memory operations in the same RISC-V hart and to the
  same address domain.
