  Vector quad widening 4D Dot Product 8-bit Integer dot-product instructions performing the dot product between two 4-element vectors of 8-bit integer elements and accumulating it into a 32-bit integer accumulator.
  
  `SEW` is used to indicate both the size of the accumulator elements and the size of the 4-element byte vectors. These instructions are only defined for `SEW`=32.
  
  These vector dot product instructions are defined with a fixed SEW value of 32. They work on an element group with four 8-bit values stored together in a 32-bit bundle. For each input bundle for the dot product there is a corresponding (same index) SEW-wide element in the accumulator source (and destination).
  
  The "q" in the mnemonic indicates that the instruction is quad-widening. The number of body bundles is determined by `vl`. The operation can be masked, each mask bit determines whether the corresponding element result is active or not.
  
  All the instructions defined in this extension fall into two schemes: vector-vector or vector-scalar.
  
  The extension includes the following instructions:
  
  * `vqdot.vv` - Vector-vector signed dot product
  * `vqdot.vx` - Vector-scalar signed dot product  
  * `vqdotu.vv` - Vector-vector unsigned dot product
  * `vqdotu.vx` - Vector-scalar unsigned dot product
  * `vqdotsu.vv` - Vector-vector signed-unsigned dot product
  * `vqdotsu.vx` - Vector-scalar signed-unsigned dot product
  * `vqdotus.vx` - Vector-scalar unsigned-signed dot product
