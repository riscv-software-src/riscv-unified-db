  This chapter describes the RISC-V hypervisor extension, which
  virtualizes the supervisor-level architecture to support the efficient
  hosting of guest operating systems atop a type-1 or type-2 hypervisor.
  The hypervisor extension changes supervisor mode into
  _hypervisor-extended supervisor mode_ (HS-mode, or _hypervisor mode_ for
  short), where a hypervisor or a hosting-capable operating system runs.
  The hypervisor extension also adds another stage of address translation,
  from _guest physical addresses_ to supervisor physical addresses, to
  virtualize the memory and memory-mapped I/O subsystems for a guest
  operating system. HS-mode acts the same as S-mode, but with additional
  instructions and CSRs that control the new stage of address translation
  and support hosting a guest OS in virtual S-mode (VS-mode). Regular
  S-mode operating systems can execute without modification either in
  HS-mode or as VS-mode guests.

  In HS-mode, an OS or hypervisor interacts with the machine through the
  same SBI as an OS normally does from S-mode. An HS-mode hypervisor is
  expected to implement the SBI for its VS-mode guest.

  The hypervisor extension depends on an "I" base integer ISA with 32
  `x` registers (RV32I or RV64I), not RV32E or RV64E, which have only 16 `x`
  registers. CSR `mtval` must not be read-only zero, and standard
  page-based address translation must be supported, either Sv32 for RV32,
  or a minimum of Sv39 for RV64.

  The hypervisor extension is enabled by setting bit 7 in the `misa` CSR,
  which corresponds to the letter H. RISC-V harts that implement the
  hypervisor extension are encouraged not to hardwire `misa`[7], so that
  the extension may be disabled.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  The baseline privileged architecture is designed to simplify the use of
  classic virtualization techniques, where a guest OS is run at
  user-level, as the few privileged instructions can be easily detected
  and trapped. The hypervisor extension improves virtualization
  performance by reducing the frequency of these traps.

  The hypervisor extension has been designed to be efficiently emulable on
  platforms that do not implement the extension, by running the hypervisor
  in S-mode and trapping into M-mode for hypervisor CSR accesses and to
  maintain shadow page tables. The majority of CSR accesses for type-2
  hypervisors are valid S-mode accesses so need not be trapped.
  Hypervisors can support nested virtualization analogously.

  = Privilege Modes

  The current _virtualization mode_, denoted V, indicates whether the hart
  is currently executing in a guest. When V=1, the hart is either in
  virtual S-mode (VS-mode), or in virtual U-mode (VU-mode) atop a guest OS
  running in VS-mode. When V=0, the hart is either in M-mode, in HS-mode,
  or in U-mode atop an OS running in HS-mode. The virtualization mode also
  indicates whether two-stage address translation is active (V=1) or
  inactive (V=0). <<HPrivModes>> lists the
  possible privilege modes of a RISC-V hart with the hypervisor extension.

  For privilege modes U and VU, the _nominal privilege mode_ is U, and for
  privilege modes HS and VS, the nominal privilege mode is S.

  HS-mode is more privileged than VS-mode, and VS-mode is more privileged
  than VU-mode. VS-mode interrupts are globally disabled when executing in
  U-mode.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  This description does not consider the possibility of U-mode or VU-mode
  interrupts and will be revised if an extension for user-level interrupts
  is adopted.
