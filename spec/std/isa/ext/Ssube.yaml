long_name: Big-endian User Mode
description: |
  `sstatus.UBE` must be capable of holding the value 1 (i.e., big-endian user mode must be supported).

  When `sstatus.UBE` is set to 1, data accesses in U-mode use big-endian byte ordering.
  Instructions are always fetched as little-endian regardless of this setting.
