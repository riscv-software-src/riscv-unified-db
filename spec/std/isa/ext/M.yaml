  This chapter describes the standard integer multiplication and division
  instruction extension, which is named `M` and contains instructions
  that multiply or divide values held in two integer registers.

  [TIP]
  ====
  We separate integer multiply and divide out from the base to simplify
  low-end implementations, or for applications where integer multiply and
  divide operations are either infrequent or better handled in attached
  accelerators.
