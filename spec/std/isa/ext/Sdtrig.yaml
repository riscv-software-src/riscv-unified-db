name: Sdtrig
long_name: Debug triggers
description: |
  Triggers can cause a breakpoint exception, entry into Debug Mode, or a
  trace action without having to execute a special instruction. This makes
  them invaluable when debugging code from ROM. They can trigger on
  execution of instructions at a given memory address, or on the
  address/data in loads/stores.

  If Sdtrig is implemented, the Trigger Module must support at least one
  trigger. Accessing trigger CSRs that are not used by any of the
  implemented triggers must result in an illegal instruction exception.
  M-Mode and Debug Mode accesses to trigger CSRs that are used by any of
  the implemented triggers must succeed, regardless of the current type of
  the currently selected trigger.

  A trigger matches when the conditions that it specifies (e.g. a load
  from a specific address) are met. A trigger fires when a trigger that
  matches performs the action configured for that trigger.

  Triggers do not fire while in Debug Mode.
