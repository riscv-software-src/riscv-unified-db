  This chapter describes the RISC-V supervisor-level architecture, which
  contains a common core that is used with various supervisor-level
  address translation and protection schemes.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Supervisor mode is deliberately restricted in terms of interactions with
  underlying physical hardware, such as physical memory and device
  interrupts, to support clean virtualization. In this spirit, certain
  supervisor-level facilities, including requests for timer and
  interprocessor interrupts, are provided by implementation-specific
  mechanisms. In some systems, a supervisor execution environment (SEE)
  provides these facilities in a manner specified by a supervisor binary
  interface (SBI). Other systems supply these facilities directly, through
  some other implementation-defined mechanism.
