name: Zihpm
long_name: Programmable hardware performance counters
description: 
  The Zihpm extension defines the unprivileged user-mode CSRs hpmcounter3-hpmcounter31 
  that provide read-only access to the corresponding machine-mode performance counters 
  mhpmcounter3-mhpmcounter31.

  When XLEN=32, the upper 32 bits of these performance counters are accessible via 
  additional CSRs hpmcounter3h-hpmcounter31h.

  The actual performance counter implementation, configuration, and behavior is 
  defined by the Smhpm extension.
