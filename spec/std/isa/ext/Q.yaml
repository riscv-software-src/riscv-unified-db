long_name: Quad-Precision Floating-Point
description: |
  128-bit quad-precision binary floating-point instructions compliant with the IEEE 754-2008
  arithmetic standard.
  `Q` depends on the double-precision floating-point extension `D`.
  With `Q`, the floating-point registers are extended to hold either a single, double, or quad-precision
  floating-point value (FLEN=128).
  The NaN-boxing is extended recursively to allow a single-precision value to be NaN-boxed inside
  a double-precision value which is itself NaN-boxed inside a quad-precision value.
