long_name: Compressed Load/Store Pair for RV32
description: |
  This extension adds load and store instructions using register pairs. It does so by reusing existing instruction encodings which are RV64-only. The specification defines 16-bit encodings.
  Load and store instructions will use the same definition of even-odd pairs as defined by the Zdinx extension.
  The extension improves static code density, by replacing two separate load or store instructions with a single one. In addition, it can provide a performance improvement for implementations that can make use of a wider than XLEN memory interface.
