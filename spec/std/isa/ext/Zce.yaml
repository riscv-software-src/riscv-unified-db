kind: extension
name: Zce
long_name: Compressed instructions for microcontrollers
description: |
  The Zce extension is intended to be used for microcontrollers, and includes all relevant Zc
  extensions.

  * Specifying `Zce` on RV32 without `F` includes `Zca`, `Zcb`, `Zcmp`, `Zcmt`
  * Specifying `Zce` on RV32 with `F` includes `Zca`, `Zcb`, `Zcmp`, `Zcmt` and `Zcf`
  * Specifying `Zce` on RV64 always includes `Zca`, `Zcb`, `Zcmp`, `Zcmt`
  * `Zcf` doesn't exist for RV64

  Therefore common ISA strings can be updated as follows to include the relevant Zc extensions, for
  example:

  * RV32IMC becomes RV32IM_Zce
  * RV32IMCF becomes RV32IMF_Zce
