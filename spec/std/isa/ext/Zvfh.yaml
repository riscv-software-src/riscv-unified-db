name: Zvfh
long_name: Vector Extension for Half-Precision Floating-Point
description: |
  This extension provides support for vectors of IEEE 754-2008
  binary16 values.
  When the Zvfh extension is implemented, all instructions in Sections
  <<sec-vector-float>>, <<sec-vector-float-reduce>>,
  <<sec-vector-float-reduce-widen>>, <<sec-vector-float-move>>,
  <<sec-vfslide1up>>, and <<sec-vfslide1down>>
  become defined when SEW=16.
  The EEW=16 floating-point operands of these instructions use the binary16
  format.

  Additionally, conversions between 8-bit integers and binary16 values are
  provided.  The floating-point-to-integer narrowing conversions
  (`vfncvt[.rtz].x[u].f.w`) and integer-to-floating-point
  widening conversions (`vfwcvt.f.x[u].v`) become defined when SEW=8.

  The Zvfh extension depends on the Zve32f and Zfhmin extensions.

  [NOTE]
  Requiring basic scalar half-precision support makes Zvfh's
  vector-scalar instructions substantially more useful.
  We considered requiring more complete scalar half-precision support, but we
  reasoned that, for many half-precision vector workloads, performing the scalar
  computation in single-precision will suffice.
