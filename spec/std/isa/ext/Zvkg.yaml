  Instructions to enable the efficient implementation of GHASHH which is used in Galois/Counter Mode
  (GCM) and Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC).

  All of these instructions work on 128-bit element groups comprised of four 32-bit elements.

  To help avoid side-channel timing attacks, these instructions shall be implemented with data-independent timing.

  The number of element groups to be processed is vl/EGS.
  vl must be set to the number of SEW=32 elements to be processed and therefore must be a multiple of EGS=4.

  Likewise, vstart must be a multiple of EGS=4.
