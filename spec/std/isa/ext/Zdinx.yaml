name: Zdinx
long_name: Double-precision floating-point instructions using integer registers
description: |
  The Zdinx extension provides analogous double-precision floating-point instructions.

  The Zdinx extension adds all of the instructions that the D extension adds, except for the transfer
  instructions FLD, FSD, FMV.D.X, FMV.X.D, C.FLD[SP], and C.FSD[SP].

  The Zdinx variants of these D-extension instructions have the same semantics,
  except that whenever such an instruction would have accessed an f register,
  it instead accesses the x register with the same number.

  = Processing of Wider Values
  Double-precision operands in RV32Zdinx are held in aligned x-register pairs,
  i.e., register numbers must be even.
  Use of misaligned (odd-numbered) registers for double-width floating-point operands is reserved.

  Regardless of endianness, the lower-numbered register holds the low-order bits,
  and the higher-numbered register holds the high-order bits:
  e.g., bits 31:0 of a double-precision operand in RV32Zdinx might be held in register x14,
  with bits 63:32 of that operand held in x15.

  When a double-width floating-point result is written to x0, the entire write takes no effect:
  e.g., for RV32Zdinx, writing a double-precision result to x0 does not cause x1 to be written.

  When x0 is used as a double-width floating-point operand, the entire operand is zero—i.e.,
  x1 is not accessed.

  Load-pair and store-pair instructions are contained in a separate extension (see Section Extensions
  for Load/Store pair for RV32).
  In case this is not available, transferring double-precision operands in RV32Zdinx from or to
  memory requires two loads or stores.
  Register moves need only a single FSGNJ.D instruction, however.
