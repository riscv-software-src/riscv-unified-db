description: |
  The atomic memory operation (AMO) instructions perform read-modify-write
  operations for multiprocessor synchronization and are encoded with an
  R-type instruction format. These AMO instructions atomically load a data
  value from the address in _rs1_, place the value into register _rd_,
  apply a binary operator to the loaded value and the original value in
  _rs2_, then store the result back to the original address in _rs1_. AMOs
  can either operate on _doublewords_ (RV64 only) or _words_ in memory. For
  RV64, 32-bit AMOs always sign-extend the value placed in _rd_, and
  ignore the upper 32 bits of the original value of _rs2_.

  For AMOs, the `Zaamo` extension requires that the address held in _rs1_ be
  naturally aligned to the size of the operand (i.e., eight-byte aligned
  for _doublewords_ and four-byte aligned for _words_). If the address
  is not naturally aligned, an address-misaligned exception or an
  access-fault exception will be generated. The access-fault exception can
  be generated for a memory access that would otherwise be able to
  complete except for the misalignment, if the misaligned access should
  not be emulated.

  The misaligned atomicity granule PMA, defined in Volume II of this manual,
  optionally relaxes this alignment requirement.
  If present, the misaligned atomicity granule PMA specifies the size
  of a misaligned atomicity granule, a power-of-two number of bytes.
  The misaligned atomicity granule PMA applies only to AMOs, loads and stores
  defined in the base ISAs, and loads and stores of no more than XLEN bits
  defined in the F, D, and Q extensions.
  For an instruction in that set, if all accessed bytes lie within the same
  misaligned atomicity granule, the instruction will not raise an exception for
  reasons of address alignment, and the instruction will give rise to only one
  memory operation for the purposes of RVWMO--i.e., it will execute atomically.

  The operations supported are swap, integer add, bitwise AND, bitwise OR,
  bitwise XOR, and signed and unsigned integer maximum and minimum.
  Without ordering constraints, these AMOs can be used to implement
  parallel reduction operations, where typically the return value would be
  discarded by writing to `x0`.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  We provided fetch-and-op style atomic primitives as they scale to highly
  parallel systems better than LR/SC or CAS. A simple microarchitecture
  can implement AMOs using the LR/SC primitives, provided the
  implementation can guarantee the AMO eventually completes. More complex
  implementations might also implement AMOs at memory controllers, and can
  optimize away fetching the original value when the destination is `x0`.

  The set of AMOs was chosen to support the C11/C++11 atomic memory
  operations efficiently, and also to support parallel reductions in
  memory. Another use of AMOs is to provide atomic updates to
  memory-mapped device registers (e.g., setting, clearing, or toggling
  bits) in the I/O space.

  The Zaamo extension enables microcontroller class implementations to utilize
  atomic primitives from the AMO subset of the A extension. Typically such
  implementations do not have caches and thus may not be able to naturally support
  the LR/SC instructions provided by the Zalrsc extension.
  ====

  To help implement multiprocessor synchronization, the AMOs optionally
  provide release consistency semantics. If the _aq_ bit is set, then no
  later memory operations in this RISC-V hart can be observed to take
  place before the AMO. Conversely, if the _rl_ bit is set, then other
  RISC-V harts will not observe the AMO before memory accesses preceding
  the AMO in this RISC-V hart. Setting both the _aq_ and the _rl_ bit on
  an AMO makes the sequence sequentially consistent, meaning that it
  cannot be reordered with earlier or later memory operations from the
  same hart.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  The AMOs were designed to implement the C11 and C++11 memory models
  efficiently. Although the FENCE R, RW instruction suffices to implement
  the _acquire_ operation and FENCE RW, W suffices to implement _release_,
  both imply additional unnecessary ordering as compared to AMOs with the
  corresponding _aq_ or _rl_ bit set.
  ====

  An example code sequence for a critical section guarded by a
  test-and-test-and-set spinlock is shown in
  Example <<critical>>. Note the first AMO is marked _aq_ to
  order the lock acquisition before the critical section, and the second
  AMO is marked _rl_ to order the critical section before the lock
  relinquishment.

  [source,asm]
  .Sample code for mutual exclusion. `a0` contains the address of the lock.
          li           t0, 1        # Initialize swap value.
      again:
          lw           t1, (a0)     # Check if lock is held.
          bnez         t1, again    # Retry if held.
          amoswap.w.aq t1, t0, (a0) # Attempt to acquire lock.
          bnez         t1, again    # Retry if held.
          # ...
          # Critical section.
          # ...
          amoswap.w.rl x0, x0, (a0) # Release lock by storing 0.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  We recommend the use of the AMO Swap idiom shown above for both lock
  acquire and release to simplify the implementation of speculative lock
  elision. cite:[Rajwar:2001:SLE]
  ====

  [NOTE]
  ====
  The instructions in the `A` extension can be used to provide sequentially
  consistent loads and stores, but this constrains hardware
  reordering of memory accesses more than necessary.
  A C++ sequentially consistent load can be implemented as
  an LR with _aq_ set. However, the LR/SC eventual
  success guarantee may slow down concurrent loads from the same effective
  address. A sequentially consistent store can be implemented as an AMOSWAP
  that writes the old value to `x0` and has _rl_ set. However the superfluous
  load may impose ordering constraints that are unnecessary for this use case.
  Specific compilation conventions may require both the _aq_ and _rl_
  bits to be set in either or both the LR and AMOSWAP instructions.
