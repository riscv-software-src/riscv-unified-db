  The `C` extension reduces static and dynamic code size by
  adding short 16-bit instruction encodings for common operations. The C
  extension can be added to any of the base ISAs (RV32, RV64, RV128), and
  we use the generic term "RVC" to cover any of these. Typically,
  50%-60% of the RISC-V instructions in a program can be replaced with RVC
  instructions, resulting in a 25%-30% code-size reduction.

  = Overview

  RVC uses a simple compression scheme that offers shorter 16-bit versions
  of common 32-bit RISC-V instructions when:

  * the immediate or address offset is small, or
  * one of the registers is the zero register (`x0`), the ABI link register
  (`x1`), or the ABI stack pointer (`x2`), or
  * the destination register and the first source register are identical, or
  * the registers used are the 8 most popular ones.

  The C extension is compatible with all other standard instruction
  extensions. The C extension allows 16-bit instructions to be freely
  intermixed with 32-bit instructions, with the latter now able to start
  on any 16-bit boundary, i.e., IALIGN=16. With the addition of the C
  extension, no instructions can raise instruction-address-misaligned
  exceptions.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Removing the 32-bit alignment constraint on the original 32-bit
  instructions allows significantly greater code density.
  ====

  The compressed instruction encodings are mostly common across RV32C,
  RV64C, and RV128C, but as shown in <<rvc-instr-table0, Table 34>>, a few opcodes are used for
  different purposes depending on base ISA. For example, the wider
  address-space RV64C and RV128C variants require additional opcodes to
  compress loads and stores of 64-bit integer values, while RV32C uses the
  same opcodes to compress loads and stores of single-precision
  floating-point values. Similarly, RV128C requires additional opcodes to
  capture loads and stores of 128-bit integer values, while these same
  opcodes are used for loads and stores of double-precision floating-point
  values in RV32C and RV64C. If the C extension is implemented, the
  appropriate compressed floating-point load and store instructions must
  be provided whenever the relevant standard floating-point extension (F
  and/or D) is also implemented. In addition, RV32C includes a compressed
  jump and link instruction to compress short-range subroutine calls,
  where the same opcode is used to compress ADDIW for RV64C and RV128C.

  [TIP]
  ====
  Double-precision loads and stores are a significant fraction of static
  and dynamic instructions, hence the motivation to include them in the
  RV32C and RV64C encoding.

  Although single-precision loads and stores are not a significant source
  of static or dynamic compression for benchmarks compiled for the
  currently supported ABIs, for microcontrollers that only provide
  hardware single-precision floating-point units and have an ABI that only
  supports single-precision floating-point numbers, the single-precision
  loads and stores will be used at least as frequently as double-precision
  loads and stores in the measured benchmarks. Hence, the motivation to
  provide compressed support for these in RV32C.

  Short-range subroutine calls are more likely in small binaries for
  microcontrollers, hence the motivation to include these in RV32C.

  Although reusing opcodes for different purposes for different base ISAs
  adds some complexity to documentation, the impact on implementation
  complexity is small even for designs that support multiple base ISAs.
  The compressed floating-point load and store variants use the same
  instruction format with the same register specifiers as the wider
  integer loads and stores.
  ====

  RVC was designed under the constraint that each RVC instruction expands
  into a single 32-bit instruction in either the base ISA (RV32I/E, RV64I/E,
  or RV128I) or the F and D standard extensions where present. Adopting
  this constraint has two main benefits:

  * Hardware designs can simply expand RVC instructions during decode,
  simplifying verification and minimizing modifications to existing
  microarchitectures.

  * Compilers can be unaware of the RVC extension and leave code compression
  to the assembler and linker, although a compression-aware compiler will
  generally be able to produce better results.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  We felt the multiple complexity reductions of a simple one-one mapping
  between C and base IFD instructions far outweighed the potential gains
  of a slightly denser encoding that added additional instructions only
  supported in the C extension, or that allowed encoding of multiple IFD
  instructions in one C instruction.
  ====

  It is important to note that the C extension is not designed to be a
  stand-alone ISA, and is meant to be used alongside a base ISA.

  [TIP]
  ====
  Variable-length instruction sets have long been used to improve code
  density. For example, the IBM Stretch cite:[stretch], developed in the late 1950s, had
  an ISA with 32-bit and 64-bit instructions, where some of the 32-bit
  instructions were compressed versions of the full 64-bit instructions.
  Stretch also employed the concept of limiting the set of registers that
  were addressable in some of the shorter instruction formats, with short
  branch instructions that could only refer to one of the index registers.
  The later IBM 360 architecture cite:[ibm360] supported a simple variable-length
  instruction encoding with 16-bit, 32-bit, or 48-bit instruction formats.

  In 1963, CDC introduced the Cray-designed CDC 6600 cite:[cdc6600], a precursor to RISC
  architectures, that introduced a register-rich load-store architecture
  with instructions of two lengths, 15-bits and 30-bits. The later Cray-1
  design used a very similar instruction format, with 16-bit and 32-bit
  instruction lengths.

  The initial RISC ISAs from the 1980s all picked performance over code
  size, which was reasonable for a workstation environment, but not for
  embedded systems. Hence, both ARM and MIPS subsequently made versions of
  the ISAs that offered smaller code size by offering an alternative
  16-bit wide instruction set instead of the standard 32-bit wide
  instructions. The compressed RISC ISAs reduced code size relative to
  their starting points by about 25-30%, yielding code that was
  significantly smaller than 80x86. This result surprised some, as their
  intuition was that the variable-length CISC ISA should be smaller than
  RISC ISAs that offered only 16-bit and 32-bit formats.

  Since the original RISC ISAs did not leave sufficient opcode space free
  to include these unplanned compressed instructions, they were instead
  developed as complete new ISAs. This meant compilers needed different
  code generators for the separate compressed ISAs. The first compressed
  RISC ISA extensions (e.g., ARM Thumb and MIPS16) used only a fixed
  16-bit instruction size, which gave good reductions in static code size
  but caused an increase in dynamic instruction count, which led to lower
  performance compared to the original fixed-width 32-bit instruction
  size. This led to the development of a second generation of compressed
  RISC ISA designs with mixed 16-bit and 32-bit instruction lengths (e.g.,
  ARM Thumb2, microMIPS, PowerPC VLE), so that performance was similar to
  pure 32-bit instructions but with significant code size savings.
  Unfortunately, these different generations of compressed ISAs are
  incompatible with each other and with the original uncompressed ISA,
  leading to significant complexity in documentation, implementations, and
  software tools support.

  Of the commonly used 64-bit ISAs, only PowerPC and microMIPS currently
  supports a compressed instruction format. It is surprising that the most
  popular 64-bit ISA for mobile platforms (ARM v8) does not include a
  compressed instruction format given that static code size and dynamic
  instruction fetch bandwidth are important metrics. Although static code
  size is not a major concern in larger systems, instruction fetch
  bandwidth can be a major bottleneck in servers running commercial
  workloads, which often have a large instruction working set.

  Benefiting from 25 years of hindsight, RISC-V was designed to support
  compressed instructions from the outset, leaving enough opcode space for
  RVC to be added as a simple extension on top of the base ISA (along with
  many other extensions). The philosophy of RVC is to reduce code size for
  embedded applications _and_ to improve performance and energy-efficiency
  for all applications due to fewer misses in the instruction cache.
  Waterman shows that RVC fetches 25%-30% fewer instruction bits, which
  reduces instruction cache misses by 20%-25%, or roughly the same
  performance impact as doubling the instruction cache size. cite:[waterman-ms]

  = Compressed Instruction Formats
  ((((compressed, formats))))

  <<rvc-form>> shows the nine compressed instruction
  formats. CR, CI, and CSS can use any of the 32 RVI registers, but CIW,
  CL, CS, CA, and CB are limited to just 8 of them.
  <<registers>> lists these popular registers, which
  correspond to registers `x8` to `x15`. Note that there is a separate
  version of load and store instructions that use the stack pointer as the
  base address register, since saving to and restoring from the stack are
  so prevalent, and that they use the CI and CSS formats to allow access
  to all 32 data registers. CIW supplies an 8-bit immediate for the
  ADDI4SPN instruction.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  The RISC-V ABI was changed to make the frequently used registers map to
  registers 'x8-x15'. This simplifies the decompression decoder by
  having a contiguous naturally aligned set of register numbers, and is
  also compatible with the RV32E and RV64E base ISAs, which only have 16 integer
  registers.
  ====
  Compressed register-based floating-point loads and stores also use the
  CL and CS formats respectively, with the eight registers mapping to `f8` to `f15`.
  ((((calling convention, standard))))
  [NOTE]
  ====
  _The standard RISC-V calling convention maps the most frequently used
  floating-point registers to registers `f8` to `f15`, which allows the
  same register decompression decoding as for integer register numbers._
  ====
  ((((register source specifiers, c-ext))))
  The formats were designed to keep bits for the two register source
  specifiers in the same place in all instructions, while the destination
  register field can move. When the full 5-bit destination register
  specifier is present, it is in the same place as in the 32-bit RISC-V
  encoding. Where immediates are sign-extended, the sign extension is
  always from bit 12. Immediate fields have been scrambled, as in the base
  specification, to reduce the number of immediate muxes required.
  [NOTE]
  ====
  The immediate fields are scrambled in the instruction formats instead of
  in sequential order so that as many bits as possible are in the same
  position in every instruction, thereby simplifying implementations.
  ====

  For many RVC instructions, zero-valued immediates are disallowed and
  `x0` is not a valid 5-bit register specifier. These restrictions free up
  encoding space for other instructions requiring fewer operand bits.
