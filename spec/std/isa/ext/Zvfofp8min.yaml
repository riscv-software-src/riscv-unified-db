kind: extension
name: Zvfofp8min
long_name: Vector OFP8 Converts
description: |
  This extension provides the minimal set of instructions needed to enable vector support of the
  OFP8 format.
  It enables OFP8 as an interchange format as it provides conversion between OFP8 values and FP32 values.
  The extension offers conversion between OFP8 and BF16 (both directions), and from FP32 to OFP8
  (only quad narrowing conversion). The narrowing conversions support both saturate and non-saturate
  modes. Both OFP8 formats, E4M3 and E5M2, are supported.

  This extension depends upon either the V extension or the Zve32f embedded vector extension.
