description: |

  Complex atomic memory operations on a single memory word or doubleword
  are performed with the load-reserved (LR) and store-conditional (SC)
  instructions. `LR.W` loads a word from the address in _rs1_, places the
  sign-extended value in _rd_, and registers a _reservation set_--a set of
  bytes that subsumes the bytes in the addressed word. `SC.W` conditionally
  writes a word in _rs2_ to the address in _rs1_: the `SC.W` succeeds only
  if the reservation is still valid and the reservation set contains the
  bytes being written. If the `SC.W` succeeds, the instruction writes the
  word in _rs2_ to memory, and it writes zero to _rd_. If the `SC.W` fails,
  the instruction does not write to memory, and it writes a nonzero value
  to _rd_.  For the purposes of memory protection, a failed `SC.W` may be
  treated like a store.  Regardless of success or failure, executing an
  `SC.W` instruction invalidates any reservation held by this hart. `LR.D` and
  `SC.D` act analogously on doublewords and are only available on RV64. For
  RV64, `LR.W` and `SC.W` sign-extend the value placed in _rd_.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Both compare-and-swap (CAS) and LR/SC can be used to build lock-free
  data structures. After extensive discussion, we opted for LR/SC for
  several reasons: 1) CAS suffers from the ABA problem, which LR/SC avoids
  because it monitors all writes to the address rather than only checking
  for changes in the data value; 2) CAS would also require a new integer
  instruction format to support three source operands (address, compare
  value, swap value) as well as a different memory system message format,
  which would complicate microarchitectures; 3) Furthermore, to avoid the
  ABA problem, other systems provide a double-wide CAS (DW-CAS) to allow a
  counter to be tested and incremented along with a data word. This
  requires reading five registers and writing two in one instruction, and
  also a new larger memory system message type, further complicating
  implementations; 4) LR/SC provides a more efficient implementation of
  many primitives as it only requires one load as opposed to two with CAS
  (one load before the CAS instruction to obtain a value for speculative
  computation, then a second load as part of the CAS instruction to check
  if value is unchanged before updating).

  The main disadvantage of LR/SC over CAS is livelock, which we avoid,
  under certain circumstances, with an architected guarantee of eventual
  forward progress as described below. Another concern is whether the
  influence of the current x86 architecture, with its DW-CAS, will
  complicate porting of synchronization libraries and other software that
  assumes DW-CAS is the basic machine primitive. A possible mitigating
  factor is the recent addition of transactional memory instructions to
  x86, which might cause a move away from DW-CAS.

  More generally, a multi-word atomic primitive is desirable, but there is
  still considerable debate about what form this should take, and
  guaranteeing forward progress adds complexity to a system.
  ====

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Note on the above note -- RISC-V now has CAS (Zacas)!!
  ====

  The failure code with value 1 encodes an unspecified failure. Other
  failure codes are reserved at this time. Portable software should only
  assume the failure code will be non-zero.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  We reserve a failure code of 1 to mean ''unspecified'' so that simple
  implementations may return this value using the existing mux required
  for the `SLT`/`SLTU` instructions. More specific failure codes might be
  defined in future versions or extensions to the ISA.
  ====

  For LR and SC, the `Zalrsc` extension requires that the address held in _rs1_
  be naturally aligned to the size of the operand (i.e., eight-byte
  aligned for _doublewords_ and four-byte aligned for _words_). If the
  address is not naturally aligned, an address-misaligned exception or an
  access-fault exception will be generated. The access-fault exception can
  be generated for a memory access that would otherwise be able to
  complete except for the misalignment, if the misaligned access should
  not be emulated.
  [NOTE]
  ====
  Emulating misaligned LR/SC sequences is impractical in most systems.

  Misaligned LR/SC sequences also raise the possibility of accessing
  multiple reservation sets at once, which present definitions do not
  provide for.
  ====

  An implementation can register an arbitrarily large reservation set on
  each LR, provided the reservation set includes all bytes of the
  addressed data word or doubleword. An SC can only pair with the most
  recent LR in program order. An SC may succeed only if no store from
  another hart to the reservation set can be observed to have occurred
  between the LR and the SC, and if there is no other SC between the LR
  and itself in program order. An SC may succeed only if no write from a
  device other than a hart to the bytes accessed by the LR instruction can
  be observed to have occurred between the LR and SC. Note this LR might
  have had a different effective address and data size, but reserved the
  SC's address as part of the reservation set.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Following this model, in systems with memory translation, an SC is
  allowed to succeed if the earlier LR reserved the same location using an
  alias with a different virtual address, but is also allowed to fail if
  the virtual address is different.

  To accommodate legacy devices and buses, writes from devices other than
  RISC-V harts are only required to invalidate reservations when they
  overlap the bytes accessed by the LR. These writes are not required to
  invalidate the reservation when they access other bytes in the
  reservation set.
  ====

  The SC must fail if the address is not within the reservation set of the
  most recent LR in program order. The SC must fail if a store to the
  reservation set from another hart can be observed to occur between the
  LR and SC. The SC must fail if a write from some other device to the
  bytes accessed by the LR can be observed to occur between the LR and SC.
  (If such a device writes the reservation set but does not write the
  bytes accessed by the LR, the SC may or may not fail.) An SC must fail
  if there is another SC (to any address) between the LR and the SC in
  program order. The precise statement of the atomicity requirements for
  successful LR/SC sequences is defined by the Atomicity Axiom in
  <<rvwmo>>.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  The platform should provide a means to determine the size and shape of
  the reservation set.

  A platform specification may constrain the size and shape of the
  reservation set.

  A store-conditional instruction to a scratch word of memory should be
  used to forcibly invalidate any existing load reservation:

  * during a preemptive context switch, and
  * if necessary when changing virtual to physical address mappings, such
  as when migrating pages that might contain an active reservation.

  The invalidation of a hart's reservation when it executes an LR or SC
  imply that a hart can only hold one reservation at a time, and that an
  SC can only pair with the most recent LR, and LR with the next following
  SC, in program order. This is a restriction to the Atomicity Axiom in
  <<rvwmo>> that ensures software runs correctly on
  expected common implementations that operate in this manner.
  ====

  An SC instruction can never be observed by another RISC-V hart before
  the LR instruction that established the reservation.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  The LR/SC sequence
  can be given acquire semantics by setting the _aq_ bit on the LR
  instruction. The LR/SC sequence can be given release semantics by
  by setting the _rl_ bit on the SC instruction.  Assuming
  suitable mappings for other atomic operations, setting the
  _aq_ bit on the LR instruction, and setting the
  _rl_ bit on the SC instruction makes the LR/SC
  sequence sequentially consistent in the C\++ `memory_order_seq_cst`
  sense. Such a sequence does not act as a fence for ordering ordinary
  load and store instructions before and after the sequence. Specific
  instruction mappings for other C++ atomic operations,
  or stronger notions of "sequential consistency", may require both
  bits to be set on either or both of the LR or SC instruction.

  If neither bit is set on either LR or SC, the LR/SC sequence can be
  observed to occur before or after surrounding memory operations from the
  same RISC-V hart. This can be appropriate when the LR/SC sequence is
  used to implement a parallel reduction operation.
  ====

  Software should not set the _rl_ bit on an LR instruction unless the
  _aq_ bit is also set, nor should software set the _aq_ bit on an SC
  instruction unless the _rl_ bit is also set. LR._rl_ and SC._aq_
  instructions are not guaranteed to provide any stronger ordering than
  those with both bits clear, but may result in lower performance.

  LR/SC can be used to construct lock-free data structures. An example
  using LR/SC to implement a compare-and-swap function is shown in
  <<cas>>. If inlined, compare-and-swap functionality need only take four instructions.

  === Eventual Success of Store-Conditional Instructions

  The `Zalrsc` extension defines _constrained LR/SC loops_, which have
  the following properties:

  * The loop comprises only an LR/SC sequence and code to retry the
  sequence in the case of failure, and must comprise at most 16
  instructions placed sequentially in memory.
  * An LR/SC sequence begins with an LR instruction and ends with an SC
  instruction. The dynamic code executed between the LR and SC
  instructions can only contain instructions from the base ''I''
  instruction set, excluding loads, stores, backward jumps, taken backward
  branches, JALR, FENCE, and SYSTEM instructions. If the ''C'' extension
  is supported, then compressed forms of the aforementioned ''I''
  instructions are also permitted.
  * The code to retry a failing LR/SC sequence can contain backwards jumps
  and/or branches to repeat the LR/SC sequence, but otherwise has the same
  constraint as the code between the LR and SC.
  * The LR and SC addresses must lie within a memory region with the
  _LR/SC eventuality_ property. The execution environment is responsible
  for communicating which regions have this property.
  * The SC must be to the same effective address and of the same data size
  as the latest LR executed by the same hart.

  LR/SC sequences that do not lie within constrained LR/SC loops are
  _unconstrained_. Unconstrained LR/SC sequences might succeed on some
  attempts on some implementations, but might never succeed on other
  implementations.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  We restricted the length of LR/SC loops to fit within 64 contiguous
  instruction bytes in the base ISA to avoid undue restrictions on
  instruction cache and TLB size and associativity. Similarly, we
  disallowed other loads and stores within the loops to avoid restrictions
  on data-cache associativity in simple implementations that track the
  reservation within a private cache. The restrictions on branches and
  jumps limit the time that can be spent in the sequence. Floating-point
  operations and integer multiply/divide were disallowed to simplify the
  operating system's emulation of these instructions on implementations
  lacking appropriate hardware support.

  Software is not forbidden from using unconstrained LR/SC sequences, but
  portable software must detect the case that the sequence repeatedly
  fails, then fall back to an alternate code sequence that does not rely
  on an unconstrained LR/SC sequence. Implementations are permitted to
  unconditionally fail any unconstrained LR/SC sequence.
  ====

  If a hart _H_ enters a constrained LR/SC loop, the execution environment
  must guarantee that one of the following events eventually occurs:

  * _H_ or some other hart executes a successful SC to the reservation set
  of the LR instruction in _H_'s constrained LR/SC loops.
  * Some other hart executes an unconditional store or AMO instruction to
  the reservation set of the LR instruction in _H_'s constrained LR/SC
  loop, or some other device in the system writes to that reservation set.
  * _H_ executes a branch or jump that exits the constrained LR/SC loop.
  * _H_ traps.

  [NOTE]
  ====
  Note that these definitions permit an implementation to fail an SC
  instruction occasionally for any reason, provided the aforementioned
  guarantee is not violated.

  As a consequence of the eventuality guarantee, if some harts in an
  execution environment are executing constrained LR/SC loops, and no
  other harts or devices in the execution environment execute an
  unconditional store or AMO to that reservation set, then at least one
  hart will eventually exit its constrained LR/SC loop. By contrast, if
  other harts or devices continue to write to that reservation set, it is
  not guaranteed that any hart will exit its LR/SC loop.

  Loads and load-reserved instructions do not by themselves impede the
  progress of other harts' LR/SC sequences. We note this constraint
  implies, among other things, that loads and load-reserved instructions
  executed by other harts (possibly within the same core) cannot impede
  LR/SC progress indefinitely. For example, cache evictions caused by
  another hart sharing the cache cannot impede LR/SC progress
  indefinitely. Typically, this implies reservations are tracked
  independently of evictions from any shared cache. Similarly, cache
  misses caused by speculative execution within a hart cannot impede LR/SC
  progress indefinitely.

  These definitions admit the possibility that SC instructions may
  spuriously fail for implementation reasons, provided progress is
  eventually made.

  One advantage of CAS is that it guarantees that some hart eventually
  makes progress, whereas an LR/SC atomic sequence could livelock
  indefinitely on some systems. To avoid this concern, we added an
  architectural guarantee of livelock freedom for certain LR/SC sequences.

  Earlier versions of this specification imposed a stronger
  starvation-freedom guarantee. However, the weaker livelock-freedom
  guarantee is sufficient to implement the C11 and C++11 languages, and is
  substantially easier to provide in some microarchitectural styles.
