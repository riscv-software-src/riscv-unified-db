description: |
  The Ztso extension provides Total Store Ordering (TSO) memory consistency semantics
  for RISC-V systems. This is an optional extension that complements the baseline
  RISC-V Weak Memory Ordering (RVWMO) model by providing stricter memory ordering
  guarantees.

  When Ztso is implemented, all loads and stores behave as if they have implicit
  acquire and release semantics, respectively. This provides a familiar programming
  model for software developed on architectures that natively support TSO, such as x86.
