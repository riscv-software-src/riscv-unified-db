introduction: |
  This profile release targets 64-bit application processors for markets
  requiring a high-degree of binary compatibility between compliant implementations.
description: |
  This profile release is intended to be used for 64-bit application
  processors running rich OS stacks.  Only user-mode and
  supervisor-mode profiles are specified in this release.

  NOTE: There is no machine-mode profile currently defined for this release.
  A machine-mode profile for application processors would only be used in specifying platforms for
  portable machine-mode software. Given the relatively low volume of
  portable M-mode software in this domain, the wide variety of potential
  M-mode code, and the very specific needs of each type of M-mode
  software, we are not specifying individual M-mode ISA requirements in this release.

  NOTE: Only XLEN=64 application processor profiles are currently defined.
  It would be possible to also define very similar XLEN=32 variants.
