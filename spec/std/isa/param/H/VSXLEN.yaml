description: |
  Set of XLENs supported in VS-mode. Can be one of:

    * 32:   VSXLEN is always 32
    * 64:   VSXLEN is always 64
    * 3264: VSXLEN can be changed (via `hstatus.VSXL`) between 32 and 64

    XLEN in VS-mode can never be larger than XLEN in S-mode
    (and, transitively, cannot be larger than XLEN in M-mode).
