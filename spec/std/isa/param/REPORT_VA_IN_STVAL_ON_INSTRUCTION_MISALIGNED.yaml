name: REPORT_VA_IN_STVAL_ON_INSTRUCTION_MISALIGNED
description: |
  When true, `stval` is written with the virtual PC when an instruction fetch is misaligned.

  When false, `stval` is written with 0 when an instruction fetch is misaligned.

  Note that when IALIGN=16 (i.e., when the `C` or one of the `Zc*` extensions are implemented),
  it is impossible to generate a misaligned fetch, and so this parameter has no effect.
