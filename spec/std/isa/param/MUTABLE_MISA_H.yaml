name: MUTABLE_MISA_H
description:
  "Indicates whether or not the `H` extension can be disabled with the
  `misa.H` bit.

  "
long_name: TODO
schema:
  type: boolean
requirements:
  idl(): MUTABLE_MISA_S -> MUTABLE_MISA_H;
  reason: |
    If S mode can be disabled, then H mode must also be disabled since you can't be in H mode
    without S mode (and thus MUTABLE_MISA_H is not an option -- it's always true)
definedBy:
  extension:
    name: H
