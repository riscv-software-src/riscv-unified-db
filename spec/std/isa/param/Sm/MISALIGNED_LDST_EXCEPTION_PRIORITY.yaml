  ! low  ! Misaligned load/store/AMO exceptions are always lower priority than load/store/AMO page-fault and access-fault exceptions.
  ! high ! Misaligned load/store/AMO exceptions are always higher priority than load/store/AMO page-fault and access-fault exceptions.
  !===

  MISALIGNED_LDST_EXCEPTION_PRIORITY cannot be "high" when MISALIGNED_MAX_ATOMICITY_GRANULE_SIZE
  is non-zero, since the atomicity of an access cannot be determined in that case until after
  address translation.
