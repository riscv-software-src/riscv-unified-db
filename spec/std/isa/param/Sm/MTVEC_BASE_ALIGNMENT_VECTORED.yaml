long_name: |
  Minumum alignment of `mtvec.BASE` when `mtvec.MODE` is 1 (vectored)
definedBy:
  allOf:
    - extension:
        name: Sm
    - param:
        allOf:
          - name: MTVEC_MODES
            includes: 1
            reason: Only relevant when vectored mode is supported
          - name: MTVEC_ACCESS
            equal: read-write
            reason: Base address is hard-coded when MTVEC_ACCESS is read-only
description: |
  Because `mtvec` excludes the two least-significant bits of
  the base, the minimum alignment cannot be less than 4.
