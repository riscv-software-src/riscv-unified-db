name: REPORT_VA_IN_STVAL_ON_BREAKPOINT
description: |
  When true, `stval` is written with the virtual PC of the EBREAK instruction (same information as `mepc`).

  When false, `stval` is written with 0 on an EBREAK instruction.

  Regardless, `stval` is always written with a virtual PC when an external breakpoint is generated
