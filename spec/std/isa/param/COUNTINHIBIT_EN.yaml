name: COUNTINHIBIT_EN
description: |
  Indicates which hardware performance monitor counters can be disabled from `mcountinhibit`.

  An unimplemented counter cannot be specified, i.e., if HPM_COUNTER_EN[3] is false,
  it would be illegal to set COUNTINHIBIT_EN[3] to true.

  COUNTINHIBIT_EN[1] can never be true, since it corresponds to `mcountinhibit.TM`,
  which is always read-only-0.
