name: MISALIGNED_SPLIT_STRATEGY
long_name: |
  The *order* the implementation appears
  to process a non-atomic misaligned load/store, which determines how/which
  exceptions will be reported.
definedBy:
  allOf:
    - extension:
        name: Sm
    - param:
        name: MISALIGNED_LDST
        equal: true
        reason: Granule size is only relevant when misaligned load/stores might execute without an exception.
description: |
  Options:

    * sequential_bytes: The load/store appears to be broken into byte-sized accesses that processed sequentially from smallest address to largest address
    * custom: Something else. Will result in a call to unpredictable() in the execution

schema:
  type: string
  enum: [sequential_bytes, custom]
