description: |
  Implementations must provide fractional LMUL settings that allow the narrowest supported type to occupy a fraction of a vector register corresponding to the ratio of the narrowest supported type's width to that of the largest supported type's width. In general, the requirement is to support LMUL >= SEW_MIN/ELEN, where SEW_MIN is the narrowest supported SEW value and ELEN is the widest supported SEW value.
