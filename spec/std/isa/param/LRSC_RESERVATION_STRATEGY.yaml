name: LRSC_RESERVATION_STRATEGY
description: |
  Strategy used to handle reservation sets.

    * "reserve naturally-aligned 64-byte region": Always reserve the 64-byte block containing the LR/SC address
    * "reserve naturally-aligned 128-byte region": Always reserve the 128-byte block containing the LR/SC address
    * "reserve exactly enough to cover the access": Always reserve exactly the LR/SC access, and no more
    * "custom": Custom behavior, leading to an 'unpredictable' call on any LR/SC
