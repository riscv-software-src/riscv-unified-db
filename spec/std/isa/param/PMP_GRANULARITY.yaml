name: PMP_GRANULARITY
description: |
  log2 of the smallest supported PMP region.

  Generally, for systems with an MMU, should not be smaller than 12,
  as that would preclude caching PMP results in the TLB along with
  virtual memory translations

  Note that PMP_GRANULARITY is equal to G+2 (not G) as described in
  the privileged architecture.
