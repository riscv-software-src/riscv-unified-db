description: |
  Indicates which counters can be delegated via `mcounteren`.

  An unimplemented counter cannot be specified, i.e., if
  HPM_COUNTER_EN[3] is false, it would be illegal to set
  MCOUNTENABLE_EN[3] to true.

  MCOUNTENABLE_EN[0:2] must all be false if `Zicntr` is not implemented.
  MCOUNTENABLE_EN[3:31] must all be false if `Zihpm` is not implemented.
