description: |
  The 'V' register file contains the 32 vector registers defined by the RISC-V
  Vector Extension (RVV). Each register holds VLEN bits of data. Under the
  current ABI spec all vector registers are caller-saved temporaries and do not
  participate in argument passing or return values.
