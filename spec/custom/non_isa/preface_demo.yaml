      This Programmer's Reference Manual (PRM) provides comprehensive documentation for a generic RISC-V processor implementation. It is intended for system designers, integrators, verification engineers, and software developers working with RISC-V-based systems.

      The manual covers the processor architecture, instruction set, control and status registers, memory management, debug and trace features, and other essential aspects. It aims to clarify both standard RISC-V features and implementation-defined options, supporting robust and portable software development.

      This document is suitable for public distribution and does not contain proprietary or vendor-specific content. All examples and descriptions are generic and based on open RISC-V standards.

          This manual is organized to guide users through the essential features of a RISC-V processor. It begins with an overview of the architecture and programming model, followed by chapters on the instruction set, privilege levels, memory subsystem, and system integration topics. Each chapter provides references to the official RISC-V specifications and highlights implementation-defined aspects where relevant.

          The manual is designed to be accessible to both new and experienced users, with clear explanations, diagrams, and practical examples. It emphasizes portability, compliance with RISC-V standards, and best practices for system design and software development.
