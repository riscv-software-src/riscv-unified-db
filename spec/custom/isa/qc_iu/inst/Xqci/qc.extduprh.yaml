long_name: Extract bits from pair unsigned, packed descriptor high part (Register)
description: |
  Extract a subset of bits from the register pair [`rs1`, `rs1`+1] into `rd`.
  The width of the subset is determined by `rs2` bits [29:24] (0..32),
  and the offset of the subset is determined by `rs2` bits [21:16] (0..63).
  In case when `rs2` bit [29] == 1 width is enforced to 32.
  In case when width == 0, to the destination register written 0.
  Instruction encoded in R instruction format.
