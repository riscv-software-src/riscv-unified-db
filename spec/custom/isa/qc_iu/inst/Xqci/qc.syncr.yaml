long_name: Non-memory-mapped device read-after-write synchronization
description: |
  This synchronization instruction delays execution till last read (input)
  from non-memory-mapped device transactions are started for specified devices.
  As well, instruction implies fence.tso functionality for all memory accesses.
  Immediate argument is 5-bit bitmask field that specifies up to five pre-defined devices.
  Instruction encoded in I instruction format.
