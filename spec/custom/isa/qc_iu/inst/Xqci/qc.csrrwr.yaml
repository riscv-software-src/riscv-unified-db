name: qc.csrrwr
long_name: Atomic Read/Write CSR (Register)
description: |
  Atomically swap values in the CSRs and integer registers.
  Read the old value of the CSR, zero-extends the value to `XLEN` bits,
  and then write it to integer register `rd`.
  The CSR number is in `rs2` register.
  The initial value in `rs1` is written to the CSR.
  If `rd`=`x0`, then the instruction shall not read the CSR and shall not
  cause any of the side effects that might occur on a CSR read.
  If `rs1`=`x0`, then the instruction shall not write to the CSR and shall not
  cause any of the side effects that might occur on a CSR write.
  Instruction encoded in R instruction format.
