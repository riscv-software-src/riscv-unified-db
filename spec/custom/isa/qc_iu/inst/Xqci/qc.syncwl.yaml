long_name: Non-memory-mapped device write-after-read synchronization to completion
description: |
  This synchronization instruction delays execution till last write (output)
  to non-memory-mapped device transactions are completed for specified devices.
  As well, instruction implies fence.tso functionality for all memory accesses.
  Immediate argument is 5-bit bitmask field that specifies up to five pre-defined devices.
  Instruction encoded in I instruction format.
