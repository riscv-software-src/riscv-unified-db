long_name: Extract bits from pair unsigned (Immediate)
description: |
  Extract a subset of bits from the register pair [`rs1`, `rs1`+1] into `rd`.
  The width of the subset is determined by (`width_minus1` + 1) (1..32),
  and the offset (into the pair) of the subset is determined by `shamt`.
  Instruction encoded in I instruction format.
