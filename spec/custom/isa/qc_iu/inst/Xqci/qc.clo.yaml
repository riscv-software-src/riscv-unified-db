description: |
  Count the number of ones before the first zero in `rs1`, starting from the MSB
  and progressing to the LSB.
  Accordingly, if the input is ~0, the output is XLEN, and if the most-significant
  bit of the input is a 0, the output is 0.
  output written to the `rd`
  Instruction encoded in I instruction format.
