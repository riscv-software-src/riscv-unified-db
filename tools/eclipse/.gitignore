# ---- TBD: Review the following rule ----
# Do we need to ignore node_modules/ everywhere under this directory?
node_modules/

udb-vscode/out/
udb-vscode/.vscode-test/

# ---- TBD: Review the following rules ----
# Starting with a "!" without a preceding ignore rule for the directory
#   means that the directory itself is not ignored, i.e., unignore patterns
#   for {launch,tasks}.json are not required.
# If the intention is to unignore only {launch,tasks}.json,
#   this should be udb-vscode/.vscode/*
!udb-vscode/.vscode/
!udb-vscode/.vscode/launch.json
!udb-vscode/.vscode/tasks.json

# Ignore everything under server/ except the jar file
udb-vscode/server/*
!udb-vscode/server/udb-ls-all.jar
