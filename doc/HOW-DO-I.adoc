== Update Ruby gems

This will run natively, so you either need to be in the container already (e.g., in the devcontainer), or you need to have rbenv installed on the host.

(If needed) Make sure you have the correct version of Ruby installed:

```bash
rbenv install
```

Then, update the gems on the host. This will update the Gemfile.lock files and sorbet definitions.

```bash
./bin/update_gems
```

Then rebuild the container:

```bash
./bin/build_container
```

Then `git add` all updated/new files and make a PR.

== Add a new Ruby gem

Add the gem in the appropriate Gemfile (top, or one of the sub-project gems under tools/ruby-gems).

Install it on the host:

```bash
bundle install
```

Then follow the proceedure in <<Update Ruby gems>>.
