= Creating a new instruction

== Easy way

`riscv-unified-db` ships with a command line tool to help add instructions to the database.

[source,bash]
----
./bin/udb create instruction
----

Follow the prompts, and at the end, the tool will point you to newly created file(s) along with
any next steps.

== Expert way

Instructions can also be added by manually adding files under `spec/**/inst`.
This is not recommended for new UDB users, though experienced users may find this path faster.

== Verifying the instruction

To test that the new instruction files conform to the UnifiedDB schema and that the IDL code is valid, run:

[source,bash]
----
./do test:smoke
----
