= Ruby interface to database

A Ruby interface for https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-unified-db[`riscv-unified-db`] is located in the `lib` directory. It can be used to query the database in the context of a configuration through a set of object models.

The main class is `ArchDef`, which represents all of the database information plus any known configuration parameters. An `ArchDef` must be initialized from a configuration in the `cfg` directory. Two configurations are provided -- _32 and _64 -- that represent generic RV32/RV64 machines (_i.e._, the only known configuration parameter is `MXLEN`). 

== Configuration files

A configuration consists of a folder under `cfgs`. Inside that folder, there are three required files and one optional directory.

=== Required configuration files

`cfg.yaml`::
A YAML object (hash) that currently contains only one field `type`. `type` can be one of:

* "partially configured": The configuration has some parameters and/or implemented extensions known, but others are not known. Examples of a _partially configured_ configuration are the generic _32/_64 configs and a profile (which has some known/mandatory extensions, but also many unknown/optional extensions). 
* "fully configured": The configuration exhaustively lists a set of implmented extensions and parameters. An example of a _fully configured_ configuration is the `generic_rv64` example, which represents a theoritical implementation of RV64. In a _fully configured_ configuration, any extension that isn't known to be implemented is treated as unimplmented, and will be pruned out of the database for certain operations.

`implemented_exts.yaml`::

A YAML file with an array of known implemented extensions along with their versions.

.Example `implemented_exts.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
implemented_extensions:
  - [A, "2.1.0"]
  - [B, "1.0.0"]
  - [C, "2.2.0"]
  - [D, "2.2.0"]
  - [F, "2.2.0"]
  # ...
----

`params.yaml`::

A YAML file with values for parameters defined by the implemented extensions. Params must be exhuastive for a _fully configured_ configuration. Params will be schema checked using information stored in the database.

.Example `params.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
params:
  MISALIGNED_LDST: true
  MISALIGNED_LDST_EXCEPTION_PRIORITY: high
  MISALIGNED_MAX_ATOMICITY_GRANULE_SIZE: 0
  MISALIGNED_SPLIT_STRATEGY: by_byte
  # ...
----

=== Optional overlay

A configuration can customize the standard RISC-V specification by providing an `arch_overlay` directory. This can be used to, for example, describe a custom extension or to create custom behavior of a standard instructions.

The `arch_overlay` directory is treated as an overlay on the standard `arch` directory. The contents of any file found in `arch_overlay` is either merged on top of the corresponding file in `arch`, if such a file exists, or added to the overall specification (_e.g._, when defining a new extension). An example of an overlay can be found in `cfgs/generic_rv64/arch_overlay`.

== ArchDef interface

An `ArchDef` is most easily obtained by using the convience function `arch_def_for(String)`, which takes the name of a folder under `cfgs`. Once you have an `ArchDef`, you can begin to query the database.

.Architecture queries
[source,ruby]
----
# get a configuration
arch_def = arch_def_for("_64")

# all extensions, implemented or not
arch_def.extensions #=> Array<Extension>

# all implemented extensions
arch_def.implemented_extensions #=> Array<Extension>

# All Parameters for the 'C' extension
arch_def.extension("C").params #=> Array<Param>

# all ratified extensions
arch_def.extensions.select { |ext| ext.state == "ratified" } #=> Array<Extension>

# all RISC-V instructions, implemented or not
arch_def.instructions #=> Array<Instruction>

# all instructions defined by an implemented extension
arch_def.implemented_instructions #=> Array<Instruction>

# the `addi` instruction
arch_def.instruction("addi") #=> Instruction

# abstract syntax tree of the `addi` execution
arch_def.instruction("addi").operation_ast #=> Idl::AstNode

# all CSRs, implemented or not
arch_def.csrs

# all CSRs defined by an implemented extension
arch_def.implemented_csrs

# the `mstatus.MPRV` CSR field
arch_def.csr("mstatus").field("MPRV") #=> CsrField
