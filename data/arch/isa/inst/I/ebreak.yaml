name: ebreak
long_name: Breakpoint exception
description: |
  The EBREAK instruction is used by debuggers to cause control to be transferred back to
  a debugging environment. Unless overridden by an external debug environment,
  EBREAK raises a breakpoint exception and performs no other operation.

  [NOTE]
  As described in the `C` Standaxd Extension for Compressed Instructions, the `c.ebreak`
  instruction performs the same operation as the EBREAK instruction.

  EBREAK causes the receiving privilege mode's epc register to be set to the address of
  the EBREAK instruction itself, not the address of the following instruction.
  As EBREAK causes a synchronous exception, it is not considered to retire,
  and should not increment the `minstret` CSR.
