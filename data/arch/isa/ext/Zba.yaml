long_name: Address generation instructions
description: |
  The Zba instructions can be used to accelerate the generation of addresses that index into
  arrays of basic types (halfword, word, doubleword) using both unsigned word-sized and
  XLEN-sized indices: a shifted index is added to a base address.

  The shift and add instructions do a left shift of 1, 2, or 3 because these are commonly found
  in real-world code and because they can be implemented with a minimal amount of additional
  hardware beyond that of the simple adder. This avoids lengthening the critical path in
  implementations.

  While the shift and add instructions are limited to a maximum left shift of 3, the `slli`
  instruction (from the base ISA) can be used to perform similar shifts for indexing into arrays
  of wider elements. The `slli.uw` -- added in this extension -- can be used when the index is to
  be interpreted as an unsigned word.
