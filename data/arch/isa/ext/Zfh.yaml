long_name: Half-precision floating point
description: |
  16-bit half-precision binary floating-point instructions compliant with the IEEE 754-2008
  arithmetic standard.
  The `Zfh` extension depends on the single-precision floating-point extension, `F`.
  The NaN-boxing scheme is extended to allow a half-precision value to be NaN-boxed inside a
  single-precision value (which may be recursively NaN-boxed inside a double- or quad-precision
  value when the D or Q extension is present).
