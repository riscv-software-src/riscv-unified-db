long_name: Main memory misaligned requirement for RVA profiles
type: unprivileged
description: |
  Misaligned loads and stores to main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence
  PMAs must be supported.

  [NOTE]
  This extension was ratified as part of the RVA20 profile.

  [NOTE]
  This requires misaligned support for all regular load and store instructions (including
  scalar and vector) but not AMOs or other specialized forms of memory access.
  Even though mandated, misaligned loads and stores might execute extremely slowly.
  Standard software distributions should assume their existence only for correctness,
  not for performance.
