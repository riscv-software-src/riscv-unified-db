long_name: Wait-on-Reservation-Set Instructions
description: |
  The `Zawrs` extension defines a pair of instructions to be used in polling loops that allows a
  core to enter a low-power state and wait on a store to a memory location.
  Waiting for a memory location to be updated is a common pattern in many use cases such as:

  * Contenders for a lock waiting for the lock variable to be updated.
  * Consumers waiting on the tail of an empty queue for the producer to queue work/data.
    The producer may be code executing on a RISC-V hart, an accelerator device, an external I/O agent.
  * Code waiting on a flag to be set in memory indicative of an event occurring.
    For example, software on a RISC-V hart may wait on a "done" flag to be set in memory by an
    accelerator device indicating completion of a job previously submitted to the device.
