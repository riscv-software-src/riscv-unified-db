long_name: Resumable Non-Maskable Interrupts
description: |
  The base machine-level architecture supports only unresumable non-maskable interrupts (UNMIs),
  where the NMI jumps to a handler in machine mode, overwriting the current `mepc` and `mcause`
  register values.
  If the hart had been executing machine-mode code in a trap handler, the previous values in `mepc`
  and `mcause` would not be recoverable and so execution is not generally resumable.

  The `Smrnmi` extension adds support for resumable non-maskable interrupts (RNMIs) to RISC-V.
  The extension adds four new CSRs (`mnepc`, `mncause`, `mnstatus`, and `mnscratch`) to hold the
  interrupted state, and one new instruction, `mnret`, to resume from the RNMI handler.
