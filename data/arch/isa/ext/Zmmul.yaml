long_name: Integer multiplication instructions
description: |
  The `Zmmul` extension implements the multiplication subset of the `M` extension.
  It adds `MUL`, `MULH`, `MULHU`, `MULHSU`, and (for RV64 only) `MULW`.
  The encodings are identical to those of the corresponding M-extension instructions.
  `M` implies `Zmmul`.

  [NOTE]
  The `Zmmul` extension enables low-cost implementations that require multiplication
  operations but not division. For many microcontroller applications, division operations
  are too infrequent to justify the cost of divider hardware. By contrast, multiplication
  operations are more frequent, making the cost of multiplier hardware more justifiable.
  Simple FPGA soft cores particularly benefit from eliminating division but retaining
  multiplication, since many FPGAs provide hardwired multipliers but require dividers be
  implemented in soft logic.
