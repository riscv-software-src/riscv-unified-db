  TIME_CSR_IMPLEMENTED:
    description: |
      Whether or not a real hardware `time` CSR exists. Implementations can either provide a real
      CSR or emulate access at M-mode.

      Possible values:

      true::
        `time`/`timeh` exists, and accessing it will not cause an IllegalInstruction trap

      false::
        `time`/`timeh` does not exist.
        Accessing the CSR will cause an IllegalInstruction trap or enter an unpredictable state,
        depending on TRAP_ON_UNIMPLEMENTED_CSR.
        Privileged software may emulate the `time` CSR, or may pass the exception to a lower level.
