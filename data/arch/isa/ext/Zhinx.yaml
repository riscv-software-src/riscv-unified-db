name: Zhinx
long_name: Half-precision floating-point instructions using integer registers
description: |
  The Zhinx extension provides analogous half-precision floating-point instructions. The Zhinx extension
  depends upon the Zfinx extension.
  The Zhinx extension adds all of the instructions that the Zfh extension adds, except for the transfer
  instructions FLH, FSH, FMV.H.X, and FMV.X.H.
  The Zhinx variants of these Zfh-extension instructions have the same semantics, except that whenever
  such an instruction would have accessed an f register, it instead accesses the x register with the same
  number.
