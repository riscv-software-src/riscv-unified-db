versions:

    state: ratified

    changes:
      - Defined the `mcountinhibit` CSR, which stops performance counters from
        incrementing to reduce energy consumption.
  - version: "1.12.0"
    state: ratified
    ratification_date: 2021-12
    changes:
      - PMP changes require an SFENCE.VMA on any hart that implements
        page-based virtual memory, even if VM is not currently enabled.
      - PMP reset values are now platform-defined.
      - An additional 48 optional PMP registers have been defined.

  HPM_COUNTER_EN:
    description: |
      List of HPM counters that are enabled.
      There is one entry for each hpmcounter.

      The first three entries *must* be false (as they correspond to CY, IR, TM in, _e.g._ `mhmpcountinhibit`)
      Index 3 in HPM_COUNTER_EN corresponds to hpmcounter3.
      Index 31 in HPM_COUNTER_EN corresponds to hpmcounter31.

  COUNTINHIBIT_EN:
    description: |
      Indicates which hardware performance monitor counters can be disabled from `mcountinhibit`.

      An unimplemented counter cannot be specified, i.e., if HPM_COUNTER_EN[3] is false,
      it would be illegal to set COUNTINHIBIT_EN[3] to true.

      COUNTINHIBIT_EN[1] can never be true, since it corresponds to `mcountinhibit.TM`,
      which is always read-only-0.

      COUNTINHIBIT_EN[3:31] must all be false if `Zihpm` is not implemented.

  MCOUNTENABLE_EN:
    description: |
      Indicates which counters can be delegated via `mcounteren`.

      An unimplemented counter cannot be specified, i.e., if
      HPM_COUNTER_EN[3] is false, it would be illegal to set
      MCOUNTENABLE_EN[3] to true.

      MCOUNTENABLE_EN[0:2] must all be false if `Zicntr` is not implemented.
      MCOUNTENABLE_EN[3:31] must all be false if `Zihpm` is not implemented.
