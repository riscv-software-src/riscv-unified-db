  Adds instructions to implement a "lookup table" for 4 and 8 bit elements inside the general purpose
  registers.

  These instructions are useful for expressing N-bit to N-bit boolean operations, and implementing
  cryptographic code with secret dependent memory accesses (particularly SBoxes) such that the
  execution latency does not depend on the (secret) data being operated on.
