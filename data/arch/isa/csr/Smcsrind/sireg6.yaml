    normative: true
    text: |
      Access to `sireg6` from M-mode or S-mode while `siselect` holds a number in a
      standard-defined and implemented range results in specific behavior that, for each combination of
      `siselect` and `sireg6`, is defined by the extension to which the `siselect` value is allocated.

  - id: csr-sireg6-typical-behavior-note
    normative: false
    text: |
      Ordinarily, `sireg6` will access register state, access read-only 0 state, or, unless
      executing in a virtual machine (covered in the next section), raise an illegal instruction
      exception.

  - id: csr-sireg6-xlens
    normative: true
    text: |
      Note that the widths of `siselect` and `sireg6` are always the current XLEN rather than SXLEN. Hence,
      for example, if MXLEN = 64 and SXLEN = 32, then this register is 64 bits when the current
      privilege mode is M (running RV64 code) but 32 bits when the privilege mode is S (RV32 code).

  - id: csr-sireg6-unimplemented
    normative: true
    text: |
      The behavior upon accessing `sireg6` from M-mode or S-mode, while `siselect` holds a value that is
      not implemented at supervisor level, is UNSPECIFIED.

  - id: csr-sireg6-unimplemented-recommendation
    normative: false
    text: |
      It is recommended that implementations raise an illegal instruction exception for such
      accesses, to facilitate possible emulation (by M-mode) of these accesses.

  - id: csr-sireg6-extension-disabled
    normative: false
    text: |
      An extension is considered not to be implemented at supervisor level if machine level has
      disabled the extension for S-mode, such as by the settings of certain fields in CSR
      `menvcfg`, for example.
