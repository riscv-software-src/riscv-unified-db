= RISC-V Unified Database

== Generated artifacts

The latest documentation artifacts generated from the HEAD of main, include ISA manuals, profiles, etc.,
can be found https://riscv-software-src.github.io/riscv-unified-db/index.html[on the GitHub pages site].

== Overview

The RISC-V Unified Database is intended to hold *all* the information needed to describe RISC-V,
including a list of extensions, instruction specifications, CSR specifications, and documentation prose. The vision is that anything one would need for RISC-V can be generated from the information in this repository.

This repository contains:

 * A (eventually complete) description of the RISC-V specification in a machine-readable format.
 * A tool to generate multiple views of that spec, including:
 ** A configuration-specific, human-readable documentation webpage
 ** [COMING SOON] A configuration-specific Instruction Set Simulator
 ** More backends are planned

== What can it do?

=== Working examples:

 * Generate https://riscv-software-src.github.io/riscv-unified-db/manual/html/index.html[configuration-specific documentation] tailored to the set of implemented extensions and unnamed implementation options (_e.g._, `./do gen:html[example_rv64_with_overlay]`).
 ** Only implemented extensions/instructions/CSRs are included
 ** Unreachable/unimplemented parts of the formal specification are pruned away
 ** A dedicated documentation page for every implemented instruction, including its encoding, pruned execution behavior, and what types of exceptions it may cause.
 ** A dedicated documentation page for every implemented CSR, including its (possibly runtime-changing) encoding, fields, and pruned behavior on reads and writes
 ** Clickable links to all mentions of instructions, extensions, CSRs, CSR fields, and glossary terms.
 * Generate documentation for specific extensions (_e.g._, `./do gen:ext_pdf[B]`)
 ** Automatically include a complete list of added instructions and CSRs
 ** Per-instruction documentation
 ** Per-CSR documentation
 ** Formal specification
 * Generate a single YAML file containing *everything* knowable about a configuration (_e.g._, `./do gen:cfg_arch[example_rv64_with_overlay]`).

=== Possibilities:

  * Generate binutils files for an extension
  * Generate instruction tables for compilers
  * Generate https://github.com/riscv/riscv-opcodes[riscv-opcodes]
  * Generate the full RISC-V specification, along with an appendix of instructions and CSRs
  * ...

== Prerequisites

There are two supported ways to run the RISC-V Unified Database,
both of which are container-based.

=== Singularity/Apptainer

You can run within `Singularity CE` (>= 3.3) or `Apptainer` (>= 1.0) container system. Either one will work (they are forks).

If it is not installed, either ask your IT admin or:

 * For Apptainer, see https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html[Apptainer Installation].
 * For Singularity CE, see https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/admin-guide/installation.html[Singularity CE Installation].

[NOTE]
You do *not* need root privileges to download or use the container. However, to modify/build the container,
you will need either root privileges or the ability to run in `fakeroot` mode. See https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/4.1/user-guide/fakeroot.html[Singularity Fakeroot Documentation] for more information.

When you run with Singularity/Apptainer, the files under `bin/`
will run within the container, _e.g._:

```bash
./bin/ruby --version
# => ruby 3.2.3 (2024-01-18 revision 52bb2ac0a6) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
```

=== Devcontainer

You can also leverage https://containers.dev/[devcontainers] to run the RISC-V Unified Database.

This is especially useful when using Visual Studio Code or GitHub codespaces, as it will setup up your IDE environment for you.

==== VS Code

To run the devcontainer locally, you will need to have https://docs.docker.com/engine/install[Docker installed].

With Docker installed, install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers[Dev Containers] extension in VS Code.

You can then run `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...` from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select the folder with this repository.

==== GitHub Codespaces

You can start a GitHub Codespace for this repository by clicking the "Code" button and selecting "Open with Codespaces".

== Tasks

Quick start:

[source,bash]
----
./do --tasks                 # list all documented tasks

## examples

# run smoke tests
./do test:smoke

# generate all versions of ISA manual, as an Antora static website
./do gen:html_manual MANUAL_NAME=isa VERSIONS=all

# generate an implementation-specific spec for the 'example_rv64_with_overlay' config
./do gen:arch[example_rv64_with_overlay]
----
